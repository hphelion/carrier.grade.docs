        <section><title>Potential Vulnerability with Intel® LAN Products with SR-IOV</title>
            <p>In Intel® LAN products with SR-IOV capability, the potential exists where, under
                specific conditions, Virtual Machines (VMs) can cause network congestion spreading,
                a well-known side-effect of Ethernet flow control, which could affect other VMs as
                well as the Hypervisor itself.</p>
            <p>For more information, see the <i>Potential Vulnerability with Intel LAN Products with
                    SR IOV</i> bulletin in the <xref

            <title>Cinder Block Storage snapshot feature not working </title>
            <!-- CG-1043 -->
            <p>For HP Helion OpenStack Carrier Grade cloud using 3PAR iSCSI configured as the Cinder
                block storage service. The Cinder volume snapshot feature might not function
                properly if following entries are enabled in the
                    <codeph>/etc/cinder/cinder.conf</codeph> file. </p>
            <codeblock>hp3par_snapshot_retention=48
hp3par_snapshot_expiration=72</codeblock>
            <p> To correct this issue, edit the <codeph>/etc/cinder/cinder.conf</codeph> file to
                disable these entries by commenting-out the entries, as follows:</p>
            <codeblock>#hp3par_snapshot_retention=48
#hp3par_snapshot_expiration=72           </codeblock>
            <p>The <codeph>hp3par_snapshot_retention</codeph> entry is the time in hours to retain a
                snapshot.</p>
            <p>The <codeph>hp3par_snapshot_expiration</codeph> entry is the time in hours when a
                snapshot expires and is deleted. </p>

        <section> LDAP conflict causing error with templates <p>When deploying templates, such as
                    <codeph>VMAutoScaling.yaml</codeph> you might receive a n error similar to the
                following: <codeblock>Error: Can’t find role heat_stack_user </codeblock></p><p>The
                problem is due to an inconsistency in the HP Helion OpenStack Carrier Grade LDAP
                implementation. To fix this problem, you should disable LDAP in Keystone and create
                few roles as mentioned below. </p><p>How you fix the problem depends upon whether
                your he HP Helion OpenStack Carrier Grade cloud is currently deployd.</p>
            <b>Cloud is not deployed</b>
            <ol>
                <li>If the HP Helion OpenStack Carrier Grade cloud is not deployed, before deploying
                    edit the <codeph>definition.json</codeph> file to set
                        <codeph>ldap_enabled</codeph> to 0.
                        <codeblock>"ldap_enabled": 0,</codeblock><p>This setting causes the cloud to
                        deploy with SQL as Keystone backend instead of LDAP.</p></li>
                <li>After you deploy the cloud, create the following roles in the Keystone by
                    logging on to one of the controller nodes: <ol>
                        <li>Source the stackrc file: <codeblock>source stackrc</codeblock></li>
                        <li>Execute the following command to create the heat_stack_owner role:
                            <codeblock>keystone role-create --name heat_stack_owner </codeblock></li>
                        <li>Execute the following command to create the heat_stack_owner role:
                            <codeblock>keystone role-create --name heat_stack_user</codeblock></li>
                    </ol></li>
            </ol>
            <b>Cloud is currently deployed</b>
            <ol>
                <li>After the cloud is deployed, on each controller, modify the
                        <codeph>/etc/keystone/keystone.conf</codeph> to comment-out the LDAP entry
                    and uncomment SQL driver, as shown:
                    <codeblock>    [identity]
    driver = keystone.identity.backends.sql.Identity
    #driver = keystone.identity.backends.ldap.Identity</codeblock></li>
                <li>Create the following roles in the Keystone by logging on to one of the
                    controller nodes: <ol>
                        <li>Source the stackrc file: <codeblock>source stackrc</codeblock></li>
                        <li>Execute the following command to create the heat_stack_owner role:
                            <codeblock>keystone role-create --name heat_stack_owner </codeblock></li>
                        <li>Execute the following command to create the heat_stack_owner role:
                            <codeblock>keystone role-create --name heat_stack_user </codeblock></li>
                    </ol></li>

            <!-- CG-1012 -->
            <p>When router is configured either centralized (server default) or distributed , it is seen that Floating IP is not working.</p>
            <p>To fix this issue, log onto <codeph>controller-0</codeph> for the KVM region and execute the following
                command to disable SNAT on the router:

        <section><title>Bonding on the control interface is not supported</title>
            <!-- CG-1052 -->
            <p>Due to an issue in <codeph>config_region</codeph> script, bonding on the control interface (hosts PXE, CLM, BLS, CAN networks) is not supported. 
                A patch to support this feature is actively being worked upon. </p>
                <p>Because of this issue, the data interface on the compute node does support balanced-xor bonding mode and Active/Standby modes. </p>

        <section><title>LAG for the KVM region control plane does not work</title>
    
            <p>Link aggregation groups (LAG) are not supported in the KVM region control plane. This is a known limitation that is scheduled to 
                be corrected with the HP Helion OpenStack Carrier Grade GA release. A LAG is a mechanism that allows multiple parallel Ethernet network connections between two hosts to be used as a
                single logical connection.</p>
