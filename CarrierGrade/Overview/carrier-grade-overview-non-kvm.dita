    <p>For installation and maintenance, HPE Helion OpenStack Carrier Grade consists of two logical
      or conceptual <i>regions</i>: Non-KVM and KVM. The Non-KVM region contains the HPE Helion
      Lifecycle Management (HLM), to deploy and maintain HPE Helion OpenStack Carrier Grade; and HP
      Helion OpenStack, a commercial-grade distribution of OpenStack.</p>
    <p><b>Note:</b> These regions do not function as OpenStack regions. </p>

<section><title>HPE Helion Lifecycle Management</title>
  <p>The Non-KVM environment includes a full installation of HPE Helion Lifecycle Management (HLM).
    HLM is an application that is used to deploy HPE Helion OpenStack Carrier
    Grade and can be used for ongoing operations and maintenance of the system.</p>
  <ul id="ul_bhj_clv_ls">
    <li>
      <p>
            <b>Physical Node Preparation.</b> HLM can configure nodes prior to installation of a
            base operating system, including node discovery/inventory, BIOS configuration,
            (specifically setting PXE boot on primary interface), GRUB settings, RAID setup for
            local disks, iLO/IPMI set up and firmware upgrades.</p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p>
            <b>OS Install.</b> HLM can take a PXE bootable node and installs a base operating
            system.</p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p>
            <b>Cloud Configuration.</b> HLM can provide detailed information about the cloud
            topology, such as the structure of control plane, assignment of services to nodes, and
            service configuration. You can also specify environment-specific configurations.</p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p>
        <b>OS Configuration.</b> HLM can automatically execute operating system configuration
        values, such as NIC assignments, NTP settings, DNS settings, NIC bonding, sysctl settings,
        VLAN creation etc. HLM uses the Ansible data model output and HLM server playbooks to
        automatically apply the per-node configurations.</p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p>
            <b>Helion Operation &amp; Maintenance.</b> HLM is responsible for the deploy, upgrade
            and maintenance lifecycle of the HPE Helion OpenStack Carrier Grade system.</p>
    </li>
  </ul>
  
</section>
 
  <section><b>ESX Integration</b><p>HPE Helion OpenStack Carrier Grade supports VMWare ESX<tm
          tmtype="reg"/> hypervisor. With our ESX integration, the cloud can provision and manage an
        ESX cluster. VMWare Compute Proxy is used as a part of ESX integration. The VMware vCenter
        driver connects to ESX clusters through Nova Compute proxy nodes. A Compute node scheduler
        sees each cluster as compute and uses the same for scheduling new instances.</p><p>The ESX
        integration uses the VRSvAPP application to connect the VMware vCenterâ„¢ networking to the
        Network Operations controller to manage workload networks.</p><p>ESX region uses mixture of
        best features from OpenStack and ESX:</p><ul id="ul_p44_snk_ws">
        <li>OpenStack features with rich services such as Keystone, Glance, Nova, Neutron, Cinder,
          Horizon</li>
        <li>ESX providing foundation for building and managing a virtualized IT infrastructure</li>
        <li>ESX providing reliability and performance</li>
        <li>ESX hypervisor abstracting processor, memory and storage</li>
        <li>Inter-region and Inter-cloud communication between different data centers</li>
        <li>ESX region uses VMDK driver using multi-backend storage support from Cinder </li>
      </ul><p>In the KVM + ESX deployment, the non-KVM region also includes integration into your
        VMware vServer storage environment.</p></section>
