        <title>Regions</title>
        <p>For installation and maintenance, HPE Helion OpenStack Carrier Grade consists of two
          logical or conceptual <i>regions</i>: Non-KVM and KVM. You will see these terms used in
          the installation process. The <xref
            href="carrier-grade-technical-overview.dita#topic3485cgto/deploy-arch">Deployment
            Architecture diagram</xref> shows an illustration of these two zones. </p>
        <p><b>Non-KVM</b></p>
        <p>The Non-KVM region contains the HPE Helion Lifecycle Management (HLM), to deploy and
          maintain HPE Helion OpenStack Carrier Grade; and HPE Helion OpenStack, a commercial-grade
          distribution of OpenStack. The ESX and DCN components and servers also reside in the
          non-KVM zone.  </p>
        <p><b>KVM</b></p>
        <p>The KVM region is the heart of HPE Helion OpenStack Carrier Grade. The KVM region consists
          of a software platform, providing ultra-reliability and exceptional performance
          efficiencies for telecommunications networks. </p>
      </section>
    <section id="dcn"><title>HPE Distributed Cloud Networking Components </title><p>The HPE Helion
        OpenStack Carrier Grade KVM + ESX deployment uses HPE Distributed Cloud Networking to provide
        virtual networking within the cloud.</p><p>DCN must be deployed before starting the cloud
        deployment. Please refer to DCN documentation for details. </p>The main components in the HP
      DCN solution are: Virtualized Services Directory (VSD) and Virtualized Services Directory
      Architect (VSD-A), Virtualized Services Controller (VSC) and Virtual Routing and Switching (VRS).<ul>
        <li>HPE Virtualized Service Directory (VSD) - The VSD is a policy engine for managing users,
          compute resources and network resources, that is located on a server outside of the HP
          Helion OpenStack Carrier Grade cloud. </li>
        <li>HPE Networks Virtualized Services Directory Architect (VSD Architect). The VSD Architect
          is a browser-based interface for management tasks on the VSD.</li>
        <li>HPE Virtual Services Controller (VSC): The VSC is a virtual machine application running
          all the control plane tasks, maintaining a full view of per-tenant network and service
          topologies. The VSC should be installed on the KVM host system within the HPE Helion
          OpenStack Carrier Grade cloud.</li>
        <li>HPE Distributed Virtual Routing and Switching (VRS): The HPE VRS is the software agent
          that runs in each Hypervisor (HV). The HPE VRS component is an enhanced Open vSwitch (OVS)
          implementation that constitutes the network forwarding plane.</li>
      </ul><p>During the installation, you will be interacting with DCN. You should be familiar with
        the major DCN components, including how to access the various systems, IP addresses, and
        user credentials. </p></section>
