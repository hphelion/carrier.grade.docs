      </ol>
      <p>The information is refreshed periodically to reflect the ongoing changes on the cluster. It
        consists of the following columns:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <b>Host Name</b> - The name assigned to the host. This is an active link pointing to the
          detailed inventory page for the host. </li>
        <li>
          <b>Personality</b> - The personality of the host (controller, compute, or storage).</li>
        <li>
          <b>Admin State</b> - The administrative state of the host. It can be in one of two states: <ul>
            <li>
              <b>Locked</b> - The host is administratively prohibited from performing services. This
              is the initial state for hosts autodiscovered in the cluster.</li>
            <li>
              <b>Unlocked</b> - The host is administratively in service. A controller node in this
              state, and not in the failed state, is active in its HA role, and is running the
              assigned controller services. </li>
          </ul></li>
        <li>
          <b>Operational State</b> - The operational state of the host. It can be in one of two
          states: <ul>
            <li>
              <b>Disabled</b> - Indicates that the host is not providing the expected services. This
              may be due to the fact that it is in the process of being unlocked, a failure has
              occurred, or it is being automatically recovered due to a failure.</li>
            <li>
              <b>Enabled</b> - Indicates that the host is providing the expected services, even if
              its operational environment is compromised. In the latter case, the host is reported
              to be in the degraded availability state, in which case, state maintenance is
              constantly trying to recover the host to fully available state through in-service
              testing. </li>
          </ul></li>
        <li>
          <b>Availability State</b> - The availability state of the host. It can be in one of the
          following states: <ul>
            <li>
              <b>Offline</b> - The host is known to the HPE Helion OpenStack Carrier Grade, but is
              not reachable for maintenance purposes.</li>
            <li>
              <b>Online</b> - The host is reachable and ready to be unlocked.</li>
            <li>
              <b>InTest</b> - A transient state that occurs when transitioning from locked, or from
              a failed operational state, to unlocked states. While in this state, the host is
              executing a series of tests to validate its hardware and software integrity.</li>
            <li>
              <b>Available</b> - The host is fully operational and providing services.</li>
            <li>
              <b>Degraded</b> - The host is experiencing compromised operational conditions, such as
              low memory, but is still providing the expected services. Details about the
              compromised conditions are available through the alarms subsystem. See System Alarms
              on page 139 for details.</li>
            <li>
              <b>Failed</b> - A major fault has occurred and the host is no longer providing any
              services. The HPE Helion OpenStack Carrier Grade maintenance system automatically tries
              to recover hosts in this state.</li>
            <li>
              <b>Power-off</b> - The host is known to have been powered off by a previous
              maintenance action. </li>
          </ul></li>
        <li>
          <b>Uptime</b> - The uptime of the host, as reported by the system maintenance
          service.</li>
        <li>
          <b>Status</b> - An indicator of the immediate activity occurring on the host. It reports
          transitory steps such as booting, initializing, configuration out of date, and in-test,
          which a host goes through as it transitions from one administrative or availability state
          to another.</li>

      <title>Locking and Unlocking a Host</title>
      <p>Unlocking a host brings the host into service. The first step is to reset the target host
        to ensure that it starts from a wellknown state.</p>
      <p>Locking a host brings the host out of service.</p>
      <p>Force locking a host takes the host out of service if for the Lock Host option does not
