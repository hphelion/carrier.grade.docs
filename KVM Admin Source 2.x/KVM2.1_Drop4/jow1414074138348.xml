    <title>Managing Storage Nodes</title>
    <shortdesc>On systems that use a <nameliteral>Ceph</nameliteral> backend for Cinder storage, you can add or replace storage disks or
        swap a storage node while the system is running, even if the storage resources are in active
        use.</shortdesc>

            <p>A HP Helion OpenStack Carrier Grade system with a Ceph storage backend uses exactly
                two storage nodes; you cannot add or remove storage nodes. However, you can add
                disks to a storage node to increase capacity, and you can replace a faulty host.</p>
            <note id="note_N1002C_N10024_N10021_N10001">
                <p>The storage node pair in a HP Helion OpenStack Carrier Grade system provides
                    redundancy for High Availability. A balanced storage capacity is recommended, in
                    which each host has sufficient independent resources to meet the operational
                    requirements of the system.</p>
