                        virtual machines. When launching a virtual machine, the Nova scheduler
                        reserves the requested memory block from the system in its entirety. The

                        the running AVS cores on each processor node. In a common scenario, the AVS
                        is deployed on two cores, not necessarily part of the same processor. When a
                        new virtual machine is launched, the Nova scheduler looks at the average
                        load incurred by AVS cores on each processor, and then selects the processor
                        with the lighter load as the target for the new virtual CPUs.</p>

                        on the AVS across virtual machines as they are deployed, and minimizing the
                        cross-NUMA inefficiencies for AVS switching.</p>
