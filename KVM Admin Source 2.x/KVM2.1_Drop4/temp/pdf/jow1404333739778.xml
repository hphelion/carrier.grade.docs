                Tree Protocol (STP) from the moment the link goes up, which usually translates into
                several seconds of delay before the trunk port moves to the forwarding state. This
                delay is likely to impact services such as DHCP and PXE which are used during
                regular operations of HP Helion OpenStack Carrier Grade.</p>
            <p ixia_locid="49" class="- topic/p ">Therefore, you must consider configuring the switch ports to which
                the management interfaces are attached to transition to the forwarding state
                immediately after the link goes up. This option is usually referred to as a <term ixia_locid="50" class="- topic/term ">PortFast</term>.</p>
            <p ixia_locid="51" class="- topic/p ">You should also consider configuring these ports to prevent them from
                participating on any STP exchanges. This is usually done by configuring them to
                avoid processing inbound and outbound BDPU STP packets completely. Consult your
                switch's manual for details.</p>
