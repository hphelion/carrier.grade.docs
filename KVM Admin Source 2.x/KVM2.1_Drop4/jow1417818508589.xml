 <title>Resource Scaling (Autoscaling)</title>
 <shortdesc>You can use Heat to reassign stack resources automatically to meet changing

 <conbody>
  <p>You can define and monitor performance thresholds for metrics such as CPU
   activity, and then add or remove resources when the thresholds are crossed. This allows you to
   make efficient use of the hardware in the cluster, by allocating resources only when they are
   needed, and assigning them where they are most required.</p>
  <p>HP Helion OpenStack Carrier Grade supports two types of scaling:</p>
  <dl>
   <dlentry>
    <dt>In/Out</dt>
    <dd>
     <p>This type of scaling (also known as <term>horizontal scaling</term>) adds or removes
      instances as needed.</p>
    </dd>
   </dlentry>
   <dlentry>
    <dt>Up/Down</dt>
    <dd>
     <p>This type of scaling (also known as <term>vertical
       scaling</term>) increases or decreases resources (for example, vCPUs) for individual
      instances as needed. For more about up/down scaling, see <xref href="jow1417813748326.xml"/>.</p>
    </dd>
   </dlentry>
  </dl>
  <p>Performance metrics can be collected and reported by the HP Helion OpenStack Carrier Grade
   platform, or by the guests using guest metrics.<!-- For more information about guest metrics, see
    <xref href="jow1404916152577.xml"/>.--> </p>
