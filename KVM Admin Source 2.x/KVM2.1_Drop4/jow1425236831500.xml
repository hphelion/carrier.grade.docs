            <p>Host NUMA nodes can be <term>pinned</term>, or
                assigned for use by VMs. For example, a VM can be configured to use NUMA node 0, so
                that when the VM is launched or migrated, the virtual machine scheduler locates a
                host node with an available NUMA node 0, and dedicates that NUMA node for use by the
                VM. For more about pinning NUMA nodes, see <xref href="jow1425236723556.xml"/>.</p>
            <p>The resources of the pinned NUMA node, including the number of
                available CPUS and the available memory, must be sufficient to meet the requirements
                of the VM, which can be specified independently. (For more about specifying NUMA
                node requirements for a VM, see <xref href="jow1425236666266.xml"/>.) To ensure that
                a given host NUMA node can support the VM requirements, you can review the CPU and
                memory complements for host NUMA nodes.</p>
            <p>To view the CPU complement for a NUMA Node (that is, for a socketed
                physical processor), use the vm-topology command. For details, see <xref href="jow1404333768530.xml"/>.<!-- But can a socketed processor contain multiple NUMA nodes?  If so, this is the wrong place to look.  Also, how can you view the available memory for a NUMA Node? -->
