 <shortdesc>The compute nodes in HP Helion OpenStack Carrier Grade form a resource pool for hosting
  guest instances. You can manage this pool by managing the hosts.</shortdesc>

 <conbody>
  <p> You can change the resource pool in several ways:</p>
  <ul id="ul_bb3_1mk_lq">
   <li>
    <p>You can add or remove hosts to increase or decrease the size of the pool.</p>
   </li>
   <li>
    <p>You can replace a host with another that has different resources (for
     example, memory, or number of CPU cores).</p>
   </li>
   <li>
    <p>You can adjust the resources on an existing host.</p>
   </li>
   <li>
    <p>You can replace a failed compute node host with an equivalent.</p>
   </li>
  </ul>
  <note id="note_N1004A_N1001D_N10001" type="caution">
   <p>When replacing or adjusting a host, ensure that the overall resource pool
    still meets the requirements for your system.</p>

  <p>Complete instructions for adding a compute node are provided in the <cite>HP Helion OpenStack Carrier Grade Software Installation Guide: Initializing and Configuring
    Compute Nodes</cite>.</p>
