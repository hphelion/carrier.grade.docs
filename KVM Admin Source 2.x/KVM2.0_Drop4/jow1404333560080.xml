            <title>Core HP Helion OpenStack Carrier Grade Capabilities</title>
            <p>HP Helion OpenStack Carrier Grade leverages core virtualization and
                carrier-grade technologies, Intel DPDK high-performance packet processing, open
                architectures, and the OpenStack software suite. It extends the OpenStack software
                suite to implement a unique carrier-grade, high-availability architecture, on which
                high-performance production systems can be deployed.</p>

                        <p>HP Helion OpenStack Carrier Grade provides significantly improved network
                            performance over the default open source OpenStack solution, up to 20
                            Gbps throughput through a guest application on a virtual machine.</p>
                        <p>At the center of HP Helion OpenStack Carrier Grade Networking is a
                            DPDK-Accelerated Virtual L2 Switch (AVS), running on the compute node
                            hosts. It provides connectivity between virtual machines on the same
                            compute node, and between virtual machines and external networks. AVS
                            supports a variety of network connectivity options with the hosted
                            virtual machines, as follows: </p>

                            <li>
                                <p>Unmodified guests can use Linux networking and
                                    virtio drivers. This provides a mechanism to bring existing
                                    applications into the production environment immediately.</p>
                            </li>

                                <p>Guest applications can be modified to leverage
                                    the Accelerated Virtual Port (AVP) drivers provided with
                                    HP Helion OpenStack Carrier Grade. AVP ports provide increased throughput over
                                    plain virtio drivers when connected to the AVS.</p>
                            </li>
                            <li>
                                <p>For the highest performance, guest applications
                                    can also be modified to make use of the Intel DPDK libraries and
                                    the AVP poll-mode drivers provided by HP Helion OpenStack Carrier Grade to connect
                                    with the AVS Switch.</p>
                            </li>
                        </ul>
                        <p>In addition to AVS, HP Helion OpenStack Carrier Grade incorporates DPDK-Accelerated Neutron
                            Virtual Router L3 Forwarding (AVR). Accelerated forwarding is used
                            between directly attached tenant networks and subnets, as well as for
                            gateway, SNAT, and floating IP functionality.</p>
                        <p>HP Helion OpenStack Carrier Grade also supports direct guest access to NICs using PCI
                            passthrough or SR-IOV, with enhanced NUMA scheduling options compared to
                            standard OpenStack. This offers very high performance, but because
                            access is not managed by HP Helion OpenStack Carrier Grade, there is no support for live
                            migration, LAG, host interface monitoring, QoS, or ACL. If VLANs are
                            used, they must be managed by the guests.</p>

                                        machine. This registration allows the compute node to
                                        monitor the health of the guest application. The frequency
                                        of the health checks is determined at registration time. The
                                        semantics of the health check, that is, determining when the
                                        application is in a good or a bad state, is under the

                        <p>HP Helion OpenStack Carrier Grade guests can make use of 
                            Server-defined VLANs to encapsulate IP traffic from a single or multiple
                            IP subnets on a virtual Ethernet interface. HP Helion OpenStack Carrier Grade tenants can
                            define one or more VLAN-tagged IP subnets on a single tenant network to
                            allow their guests’ traffic to be encapsulated on VLAN IDs of their
                            choice. These TiS-defined VLAN-tagged IP subnets have access to all of
                            the services of the virtualized network infrastructure, such as DHCP,
                            virtual routing, meta-data server, etc.</p>

                        <p>Alternately, HP Helion OpenStack Carrier Grade guests can make use of
                            transparent VLANs, in which packets are encapsulated within a provider
                            network segment without removing or modifying the guest VLAN tag(s).
                            VLAN Transparent provides more flexibility with respect to how VLAN
                            tagged packets are handled without requiring that you pre-define which
                            VLAN instances will be used. A guest can send/receive VLAN tagged
                            packets (802.1q) and/or double VLAN tagged packets (802.1ad) without
                            first defining a VLAN-tagged subnet in HP Helion OpenStack Carrier Grade. In addition, a
                            VLAN transparent network will also propagate VLAN priority information
                            (802.1p) to the destination VM instance. However, as a consequence of
                            allowing arbitrary VLAN instances, you loose the ability to access DHCP
                            servers, virtual routers, or meta-data servers over those VLAN-tagged
                            networks. </p>
                        <p>Support for Guest VLANs is a key capability that facilitates the porting
                            of current user applications running on dedicated physical servers using
                            VLANs to a virtualized environment.</p>
