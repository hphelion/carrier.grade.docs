            HP Helion OpenStack Carrier Grade, which add to the already powerful set of management tools available
            from OpenStack. The exclusive features include virtual machine settings to optimize the
            use of virtual CPUs, improvements to the scheduling algorithms, better integration of
            NUMA architectures, and others.</p>
