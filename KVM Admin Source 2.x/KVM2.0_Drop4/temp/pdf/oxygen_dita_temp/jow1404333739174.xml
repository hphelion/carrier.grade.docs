        <p ixia_locid="26" class="- topic/p ">Tenant networks need support from the physical layers to work as
            intended. This means that the access L2 switches, providers' networks, and data
            interface definitions on the compute nodes, must all be properly configured. In
            particular, when using provider networks of the VLAN or VXLAN type, getting the proper
            configuration in place requires additional planning. </p>
        <p ixia_locid="27" class="- topic/p ">For provider networks of the VLAN type, consider the following
            guidelines:</p>

     defined on the provider networks they provide access to. The dynamic nature of the cloud might
     force the set of VLANs in use by a particular L2 switch to change at any moment.</p>

                    changes over time. The current VLAN set in use is determined by the
                    configuration details of the tenant networks, and the scheduling on the compute
                    nodes of the virtual machines that use them. This information is provided to the
                    Neutron's AVS plugin, which then uses it to configure the AVS as required.</p>

                    allocation strategy is to look first for an available segmentation identifier
                    owned by the tenant. If none is available, the search continues over the
                    available shared segmentation identifiers. The allocation process returns an
                    error if no segmentation identifiers are available.</p>
