  <p ixia_locid="19" class="- topic/p ">You can enable CPU scaling for an instance by setting a scaling range (see <xref href="jow1417817540528.xml" ixia_locid="20" class="- topic/xref "/>). You must also specify the use of dedicated CPUs (see <xref href="jow1429544935360.xml" ixia_locid="21" class="- topic/xref "/>).</p>
  <p ixia_locid="4" class="- topic/p ">When an instance is first started, all available vCPUs are brought online. If
   the instance is restarted, the number of online vCPUs is set to match the number when the
   instance was stopped. This is controlled by a helper script that automatically takes the required
   number of vCPUs offline.</p>
  <p ixia_locid="17" class="- topic/p ">When CPU resources are scaled up, a vCPU is brought online from the pool of
   available vCPUs for the instance, subject to the maximum allowed by the flavor. The
   lowest-numbered offline vCPU is selected.</p>
  <p ixia_locid="11" class="- topic/p ">When CPU resources are scaled down, a vCPU is taken offline, subject to the
   minimum allowed by the flavor. By default, the highest-numbered online vCPU is selected. This can
   be overridden using the App Scale Helper script. </p>
