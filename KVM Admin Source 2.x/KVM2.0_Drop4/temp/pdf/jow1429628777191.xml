      other hosts. The agents offload the centralized router for east-west (tenant-to-tenant)

  <!-- "I wouldn't talk about Accelerated DVR until we do it" - Greg -->
  <!--  <p>An Accelerated DVR (to be made available in a later release) is implemented adjacent to the AVS
   switch on each host to provide DPDK-accelerated east-west andL3 forwarding. North-South L3
   Forwarding and SNAT may also be accelerated by implementing the centralized-portion of the router
   as a VM configured to use multiple dedicated cores, instead of sharing the single platform core
   with TiS and OpenStack Agents.</p> -->
