 <title>Host Memory Provisioning</title>
 <shortdesc>For each NUMA node on a host, you can adjust the amount of memory
  reserved for platform use, and the size and number of memory pages allocated for use by
  VMs.</shortdesc>

 <conbody>
  <p>Memory not reserved for platform use is made available as VM memory. By
   default, the VM memory is partitioned using 2 MiB huge pages. You can change this for individual
   NUMA nodes to use a combination of 2 MiB, and 1 GiB huge pages. Using larger pages can reduce
   page management overhead and improve system performance for systems with large amounts of virtual
   memory and many running instances.</p>
  <p>You can use the <cmdname>system host-memory-list</cmdname> and
    <cmdname>system host-memory-show</cmdname> commands to see how much memory is
   available for VMs. This information is also shown on the <uicontrol>Memory</uicontrol> tab of the <wintitle>Host Inventory</wintitle> page (see
    <xref href="jow1404333795559.xml"/>). </p>
  <p>After setting the memory allocations for a host, you can save them as a <term>memory profile</term>, and then apply the profile to other hosts. For more
   information, see <xref href="jow1429811350849.xml"/>.</p>
  <p>For individual VMs, you can specify which page size to use. For more
   information, see <xref href="jow1424723681500.xml"/>.</p>
