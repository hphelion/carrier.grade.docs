 <conbody>
  <p>To make changes to a host, you must lock it. Locking a host automatically and
   seamlessly redirects activity to other available hosts. While the host is locked, you can safely
   power it down and make disk changes, or remove the host and insert a new one.</p>
  <p>After making the required configuration changes, you can unlock the host and
   begin using it.</p>
