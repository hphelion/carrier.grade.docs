 <title>The Board Management Network</title>
 <shortdesc>The board management network is an optional network used for hardware
  management facilities.</shortdesc>

  <draft-comment author="rstone">US64066 adds Quanta; US64069 mention
   sensors</draft-comment>
  <p>This network provides access to iLO3, iLO4 or Quanta Integrated Lights Out
   board management modules optionally installed in the hosts. These modules provide support for
   remote reset and power control of the hosts, and in some cases for hardware sensor monitoring and
   reporting.</p>
  <p>The board management network can be implemented so that it is accessible
   externally using the OAM network, or only accessible internally to the hosts in the cluster. This
   choice is made at system installation, during the configuration controller script. For details,
   see the <cite>HP Helion OpenStack Carrier Grade Software Installation Guide: The Controller
    Configuration Script</cite>.</p>
  <section id="section_N10036_N10024_N10001">
   <title>Configuration for External Access</title>
   <p>For external access, do not configure a board management network during the
    controller configuration script (press <userinput>n</userinput> when prompted). </p>
   <p>After completing the script, you must also do the following:</p>
   <ul id="ul_kw4_qpp_ds">
    <li>
     <p>Configure each iLO module to use static IP addressing.</p>
    </li>
    <li>
     <p>Peform additional host and module provisioning, as described in <xref format="dita" href="#jow1406727863674/module_and_host_provisioning"/>.</p>
    </li>
    <li>
     <p>Ensure that the OAM Default Gateway specified during controller
      configuration has access to the board management network.</p>
    </li>
   </ul>
  </section>
  <section id="section_N1006F_N10024_N10001">
   <title>Configuration for Internal Access</title>
   <p>For internal access, configure a board management network during the
    controller configuration script (press <userinput>y</userinput> when prompted,
    and then specify a VLAN ID and a subnet). This configures a VLAN ID on the controller management
    interface for use with a board management network. To complete the VLAN, you must connect the
    modules to VLAN-tagged ports on an internal L2 switch. The modules are assigned IP addresses
    from the specified subnet.</p>

   <p>The figure above illustrates how the board management network operates when
    configured for internal access. Compute nodes connect using iLO modules, while
    controller nodes use the management port in tagged mode. As indicated in the figure, the
    controller nodes can optionally attach using their own iLO modules, if available.</p>

       <p>Add each of the ports used to connect an iLO module to the VLAN.</p>
      </li>
      <li>
       <p>Add the ports used to connect the controllers to the internal management
        network to the VLAN. You must ensure that these ports are tagged ports for this VLAN, that
        is, that outgoing board management traffic (toward the controllers) uses ï»¿IEEE 802.1Q
        tagging. Other management traffic on this port is untagged.</p>

  <section id="module_and_host_provisioning">
   <title>Host and iLO Module Provisioning for a Board Management Network</title>
   <p>For internal or external access, you must perform the following additional
    provisioning:</p>
   <ul id="ul_tmg_cmp_ds">
    <li>
     <p>Provision each iLO module with a username and password for secure
      access.</p>
    </li>
    <li>
     <p>Provision each host with the MAC address of the attached iLO module. This is
      required so that the system can associate the module's assigned IP address with the correct
      host.</p>
    </li>
    <li>
     <p>For external-access configurations only, provision each host with the IP address of the
      attached iLO module.</p>
    </li>
    <li>
     <p>Provision each host with the username and password of the attached iLO
      module. This is required for controller access to the module.</p>
    </li>
   </ul>
   <p>For module provisioning, consult the user documentation supplied with the
    equipment.</p>
   <p>For host provisioning, you can use the <wintitle>Board
     Management</wintitle> tab on the <wintitle>Edit Host</wintitle> dialog box, or
    the CLI. For more information, see the <cite>HP Helion OpenStack Carrier Grade Software Installation
    Guide</cite>.</p>
