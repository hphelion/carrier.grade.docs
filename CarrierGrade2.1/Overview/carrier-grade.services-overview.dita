<p>HP Helion OpenStack Carrier Grade is comprised of several integrated services. Each service works
      through an API (application programming interface) that allows services to work together and
      allows users to interact with the services.</p>
<section id="hp-helion-openstack-services">
<p>This page contains the following information:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<xref type="section" href="#topic4220/service">Service User Accounts</xref>

</ul>
<p>In addition to the APIs, you can interact with the most services through a graphic user interface (dashboard or console) or a command line interface (CLI).</p>
</section>
<section id="service"> <title>Service User Accounts</title>
<p>The HP Helion OpenStack Carrier Grade installation process creates a <b>service</b>
        <b>user</b> account for each installed service. Service user accounts require elevated
        privileges to validate end user tokens. It is therefore strongly recommended that you do <b>
          <i>not</i>
        </b> add these service user accounts to any project because this could allow project users
        to access services they should not have permission to access.</p>
<p>The service user accounts include, but are not limited to, the following:</p>
<ul>
<li>Nova</li>
<li>Neutron</li>
<li>Glance</li>
<li>Cinder</li>
<li>Heat</li>
<li>Keystone</li>
<li>Ceilometer</li>
