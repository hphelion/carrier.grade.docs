    <p><!--Here is the wiki link for Attis.<xref href="https://rndwiki.corp.hpecorp.net/confluence/pages/viewpage.action?pageId=946944841" format="html" scope="external">https://rndwiki.corp.hpecorp.net/confluence/pages/viewpage.action?pageId=946944841</xref> 
The high level design needs to be adjusted to more suite with CG(It is reflecting CS in some areas)I will soon update it. 
But the CLI, REST API etc should all be same --></p>
    <p>This page explains how to backup and restore HPE OpenStack Carrier Grade and HPE DCN
      configuration files in the event of catastrophic failure. The page also explains how to
      recover the <tm tmtype="reg">Percona</tm>
      <tm tmtype="reg">XtraDB</tm> cluster on the cloud controllers in the event of a database
      corruption.</p>
    <p>HP Helion OpenStack Carrier Grade includes a backup and restore application called Attis
      which you can use to backup and restore essential system files and components of the non-KVM
      cloud. Attis is automatically installed on each of the controller nodes in the non-KVM region.
      Attis uses a command line interface. For more information, see <xref
        href="CGH-2--backup-restore-cli.dita#topic10581c2brc">Attis Backup and Restore CLI</xref>.</p>
    <p>The installation also includes the Percona XtraDB application, which takes care of
      synchronization of the data between nodes if one of the nodes goes down and comes back later.
      You can use Percona XtraDB to backup and restore the MySQL nodes that the HP Helion OpenStack
      Carrier Grade installs in the non-KVM region.</p>
    <section>
      <title>IMPORTANT: Attis Administrator Responsibilites for Protecting Credentials</title>
      <p> Attis performs encrypted backup and restore of system data. The key for encryption and
        decryption is stored in the Attis configuration file on each controller node. If this key is
        lost, your backups can not be restored. Consider storing the backup encryption key
        separately from your cloud infrastructure, in addition to the copy stored on each controller
        node.</p>
      <p> Be aware that keys and passwords for other OpenStack services are stored in configuration
        files on cloud infrastructure nodes, protected by filesystem controls. Protect servers from
        unauthorized access and protect against exposure of credentials in configuration files.
        Attis backups contain copies of these credentials as well, protected from snooping via
        backup encryption, but exposure of the Attis backup key could result in unauthorized
        exposure of credentials stored in backups.</p>

      <title>What gets backed up</title>
      <p>The following components can be backed up and restored:</p>
      <p>
        <ul id="ul_hwh_hg3_pt">
          <li><tm tmtype="reg">Percona</tm>
            <tm tmtype="reg">XtraDB</tm> cluster on the controllers.</li>
          <li><tm tmtype="reg">Percona</tm>
            <tm tmtype="reg">XtraDB</tm> cluster on the VSD host.</li>
          <li>All files under the <codeph>/opt/</codeph> folder on the HLM host.  This backs up all
            the installed code/configuration and also h* installation scripts.</li>
          <li>All files under the <codeph>/root/</codeph> folder on the HLM host. This backs up all
            the source code, packages, hlinux netboot, infra-ansible-playbooks, SSH keys, as well as
            cloud folders.</li>
          <li>bog.cfg and config.cfg files on the VSC switch.</li>
          <li>KVM-region backups from the backup utility  </li>
          <li>MySQL databases and Neutron, Nova, Ironic files under /etc on the baremetal controller
            (Sacramento deployments only)</li>
        </ul>
      </p>
      <p><b>Important:</b> Do not store backup of the JSON files inside your cloud directory or any
        where inside the <codeph>/var/hlm/clouds</codeph> directory. You can create a backup folder
        on <codeph>/root/</codeph> directory or on a remote system. <!--HCG-681--></p>
    </section>
    <section><title>When to perform backups</title>
      <p>We recommend performing regular backups, preferably hourly, and especially after changing
        the appliances configuration and before and after updating HP Helion OpenStack Carrier Grade
        software.</p>
      <p>Additionally, you should create a backup from HLM VM as follows:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>when the HP Helion OpenStack Carrier Grade installation is complete,</li>
        <li>when any change is made to the HP Helion OpenStack Carrier Grade components, </li>
        <li>after syncing the files on the HLM VM. The files should be synced periodically using a
          tool appropriate for your environment.</li>
      </ul>
    </section>
    <section>
      <title>When to restore</title>
      <p>You should restore the HLM VM if there are any issues with the HP Helion OpenStack Carrier
        Grade components, for example:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>there is any problem with a VM;</li>
        <li>there is any problem in the operating system level;</li>
        <li>there is any problem with the installation that cannot be corrected.</li>
        <li> when two controllers have failed. HA Services are not guaranteed to be resilient after
          a second failure.</li>
      </ul>
      <p><b>Important:</b> During the restore process the original HLM VM will be deleted from the
        HLM host. </p>

      <title>Backup and Restore the MySQL cluster</title>
      <p>This section deals with the disaster recovery scenarios of the three node MySQL cluster
        (Percona XtraDB Cluster) that runs in cloud controller nodes. The HP Helion OpenStack
        Carrier Grade backup/restore process includes the MySQL cluster.</p>
      <p>If an entire cluster goes down, due to an issue (such as data corruption or MySQL defect),
        and the cluster does not come back up, you must restore the cluster to a previous well-known
        state (backup) and start the cluster from that point.</p>
      <p>You should take full backups of the MySQL cluster frequently, such as on a daily basis.
        Backing up the node on any single controller will backup the full cluster.</p>
      <p>If the full cluster goes down or some data corruption occurs, delete the current data in
        all of the three nodes of MySQL and restore the backup copy on the same node from which
        backup was taken. Then, bootstrap the cluster and bring up rest of the nodes to synchronize
        the data with the recovered node of cluster.</p>

    <section><title>Backing up the HP Helion OpenStack Carrier Grade</title>
      <p>To back up an HP Helion OpenStack Carrier Grade appliance (for example, the lifecycle
        manager, a controller, the VSC, the VSD and so forth), use the following steps:</p>
      <ol>
        <li>Log in to the controller.</li>
        <li> Authenticate using the <codeph>source stackrc</codeph> command or export the variables

      <title>Restore the HP Helion OpenStack Carrier Grade</title>
      <p>To restore an HP Helion OpenStack Carrier Grade appliance (for example, the lifecycle
        manager, a controller, the VSC, the VSD and so forth), use the following steps:</p>
      <ol id="ol_vlq_wm3_pt">
        <li>Log in to the controller as cghelion user. The default password is
            <codeph>cghelion</codeph>.</li>
        <li>Execute the following commands to change to the Attis
          user:<codeblock>sudo -i
su attis</codeblock></li>
        <li>Execute the following command on all three controllers to copy the Attis public key to
          the VSD <systemoutput>authorized_keys</systemoutput> file:
          <codeblock>ssh-copy-id vsd_user@vsd_address</codeblock>The <i>vsd_address</i> can be found
          in the <systemoutput>/etc/attis/dcn.lst</systemoutput> file:
          <pre>cat /etc/attis/dcn.lst</pre></li>
        <li> Authenticate using export
          variables:<codeblock>export OS_TENANT_NAME=admin 
export OS_USERNAME=admin 
export OS_PASSWORD=1234 
export OS_AUTH_URL=http://127.0.0.1:5000/v2.0</codeblock>Optionally
          you can pass the authentication values when you execute a CLI command
          <codeblock>--os-tenant-name "admin" --os-username "admin" --os-password "1234" --os-auth-url "http://127.0.0.1:5000/v2.0"</codeblock></li>

      <p>SSH to VSD node and execute the following command after restoring
        VSD:<codeblock>service vsd restart</codeblock></p>
      <p><b>After restoring the controller database:</b></p>
      <ol id="ol_blr_crk_zt">
        <li>After restore job is complete, from the HLM host, SSH to the compute proxy nodes. </li>
