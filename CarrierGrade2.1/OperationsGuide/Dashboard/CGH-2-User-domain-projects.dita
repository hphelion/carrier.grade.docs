        <section><p>When working in HP Helion OpenStack Carrier Grade Horizon interface,
                    <b>admin</b> users can make changes that affect a specific project or all
                projects in the domain. <ul id="ul_q5f_shf_2v">
                    <li>Project panel -- Changes made though the <b>Project</b> panel affect only
                        the currently selected project. A non-admin can access only the
                            <b>Project</b> panel. </li>
                    <li>Admin panel -- Changes made throught the <b>Admin</b> panel generally affect
                        all projects. An admin can access the <b>Admin</b> panel. </li>
                </ul></p>When working in HP Helion OpenStack Carrier Grade, you can log in as an
                <b>admin</b> user or a <b>non-admin user</b>. <ul>
                <li>admin user -- an admin user can work with the entire domain: all projects, all
                    users. An admin can access the Admin panel. Changes in the admin panel generally
                    affect all projects.</li>
                <li>non-admin user -- a non-admin user can work with projects assigned to that user.
                    A non-admin can access only the Project panel. Changes in the project affect
                    only the currently selected project.<p>In the Horizon interface, you can use a
                        selector to move between the projects.</p><image
