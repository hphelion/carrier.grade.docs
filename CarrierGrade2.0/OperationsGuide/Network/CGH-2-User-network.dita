<p>You can use the dashboards to create, delete, and configure your HP Helion OpenStack network and subnet(s). You can also manage the ports in your network.</p>
<p>How you interact with your network environment depends upon your user type, either an administrative user (admin) or a non-administrative user (user).</p>

<note> The admin can perform all of the user tasks in addition to the admin tasks.</note>
