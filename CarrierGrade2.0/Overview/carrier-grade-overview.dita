              switching network traffic between the core network and the virtualized applications or

              region. AVS is an optimization of Open vSwitch (OVS) technology for NFV environments.
              Open vSwitch is a multilayer software switch licensed under the open source Apache 2
              license. AVS provides connectivity between virtual machines on the same compute node,
              and between virtual machines and external networks. AVS is for customers who are
              focused on Virtualized Infrastructure Manager (VIM) key features like line rate
              performance and high
              availability.<!-- Final sentence from https://wiki.hpcloud.net/display/iaas/HCG+Arch+-+NFV-->
            </p>
            <p>AVS supports a variety of network connectivity options with the hosted virtual

            <p><b>PCI Passthrough</b>. A passthrough Ethernet interface is a physical PCI Ethernet
              NIC on a compute node to which a virtual machine is granted direct access. This

              considerations. For all purposes, a PCI passthrough interface behaves as if it were
              physically attached to the virtual machine.</p>
