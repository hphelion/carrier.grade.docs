        <p>When a compute or storage node is added to HP Helion OpenStack Carrier Grade and
          initialized, Ethernet interfaces are created automatically for each physical
          port detected.</p>  
        <p>For a network that uses Ethernet interfaces, you can edit an
          existing Ethernet interface on the node to attach it, as described in this
          topic. </p>

          Launch the HP Helion OpenStack Horizon Dashboard</xref>.</li>  
    <li>Open the <b>Inventory Detail</b> page for the host. <ol>
          <li>On the <b>Admin</b> pane of the web administration interface, in the <b>System
              Panel</b> section, select <b>Inventory</b>.</li>
          <li>Select the <b>Hosts</b> tab, and then in the <b>Host Name</b> column, click the name
            of the host.</li>
        </ol></li>
      <li>Select the <b>Interfaces</b> tab.</li>
      <li>Click <b>Edit Interface</b> for the interface you want to attach to a network. <p>For an
            <b>Ethernet</b> interface, the <b>Port</b> is already selected.</p></li>
      <li>Select the type of network for the interface. <ul>
          <li><b>Interface Name</b>. A name used to identify the interface.</li>
          <li><b>Network Type</b>. The type of network to which the interface is attached.
                <p><b>Note:</b> This selection supports multiple network types on the same logical
              interface. HP Helion OpenStack Carrier Grade also supports multiple network types on
              the same physical interface, using VLAN interfaces.</p><p>You can select multiple
              check boxes, but the only valid multiple selection is data in addition to either
                <codeph>mgmt</codeph> or infra on the interface connected to the management or
              infrastructure network. Depending on the interface, the check box options may include: <ul>
                <li>none - Clears the Network Type setting.</li>
                <li>infra - Attaches the interface to an infrastructure network. <p>When a compute
                    or storage node is added to HP Helion OpenStack Carrier Grade, an interface must
                    be attached to the infrastructure network before the node can be unlocked. You
                    can edit the infrastructure interface to add a data network and provider
                    network. This allows both infrastructure and data traffic to be carried on the
                    interface.</p></li>
                <li>oam - Attaches the interface to the OAM network. <p>The OAM network is used by
                    controller nodes for administrator remote access. It is not applicable to
                    compute or storage nodes.</p></li>
                <li>mgmt - Attaches the interface to the management network. <p>When a compute or
                    storage node is added to HP Helion OpenStack Carrier Grade, the interface used
                    for PXE boot is assigned automatically to the management network. In the
                    settings for this interface, mgmt is already selected. For other interfaces,
                    this selection is not used. You can edit the management interface to add a data
                    network and provider network. This allows both management and data traffic to be
                    carried on the interface.</p></li>
                <li>pci-passthrough - Provides for a direct connection to physical interface
                  hardware and the attached provider network from a virtual machine. A single VM can
                  directly access the physical interface. For more information, see the HP Helion
                  OpenStack Carrier Grade Administration Guide: PCI Passthrough Ethernet
                  Devices.</li>
                <li>data - Attaches the interface to a provider network. <p>You can add a data
                    interface to a management or infrastructure interface by editing the interface
                    and selecting data in addition to mgmt or infra.</p></li>
                <li>pci-sriov - Provides for a direct connection to a virtual unit of physical
                  interface hardware, and the attached provider network, from a virtual machine.
                  Multiple VMs can directly access and share the same physical interface.</li>

      <li>Complete the required information for the type of interface.
