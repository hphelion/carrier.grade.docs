      <title>Regions</title>
      <p>For installation and maintenance, HP Helion OpenStack Carrier Grade consists of two
        logical or conceptual <i>regions</i>: Non-KVM and KVM. You will see these terms used in the
        installation process. The <xref
          href="carrier-grade-technical-overview-tahoe.dita#topic3485cgtot/deploy-arch">Deployment Architecture
          diagram</xref> shows an illustration of these two zones. </p>
      <p><b>Non-KVM</b></p>
      <p>The Non-KVM region contains the lifecycle manager, to deploy and
        maintain HP Helion OpenStack Carrier Grade; and HP Helion OpenStack, a commercial-grade
        distribution of OpenStack. The ESX and DCN components and servers also reside in the non-KVM
        zone. </p>
      <p><b>KVM</b></p>
      <p>The KVM region is the heart of HP Helion OpenStack Carrier Grade. The KVM region consists
        of a software platform, providing ultra-reliability and exceptional performance efficiencies
        for telecommunications networks. </p>

      <ul id="ul_ddb_ryh_f5">
        <li><b>Lifecycle manager</b> The lifecycle manager deploys and manages HP Helion OpenStack
          Carrier Grade, consisting of a controller running shared services and the nodes required
          to run DCN (as needed).</li>
        <li><b>Non-KVM Region Controller</b>. Standard IaaS control plane to enable cloud-to-cloud
          communication. </li>
        <li><b>StoreVirtual/3PAR</b>: Hardware storage array used as backend for Cinder. Support for
          3PAR has a similar architecture as StoreVirtual on iSCSI, not Fibre.</li>
        <li><b>KVM Region Controller</b>: Real-time control plane for compute and networking.
          Contains modified versions of most of the OpenStack components.</li>
        <li><b>KVM Region Compute</b>: Realtime compute node with networking components.</li>
        <li><b>Orchestrator</b>: This could be any application consuming the cloud services.

    <section id="dcn"><title>HPE Distributed Cloud Networking Components </title><p>The HP Helion
        OpenStack Carrier Grade Tahoe deployment uses HPE Distributed Cloud Networking to
        provide virtual networking within the cloud.</p><p>DCN must be deployed before starting the
        cloud deployment. Please refer to DCN documentation for details. </p>The main components in
      the HP DCN solution are: Virtualized Services Directory (VSD) and Virtualized Services
      Directory Architect (VSD-A), Virtualized Services Controller (VSC) and Virtual Routing and
      Switching (VRS).<ul>
        <li>HPE Virtualized Service Directory (VSD) - The VSD is a policy engine for managing users,
          compute resources and network resources, that is located on a server outside of the HP
          Helion OpenStack Carrier Grade cloud. </li>
        <li>HPE Networks Virtualized Services Directory Architect (VSD Architect). The VSD Architect
          is a browser-based interface for management tasks on the VSD.</li>
        <li>HPE Virtual Services Controller (VSC): The VSC is a virtual machine application running
          all the control plane tasks, maintaining a full view of per-tenant network and service
          topologies. The VSC should be installed on the KVM Host system within the HP Helion
          OpenStack Carrier Grade cloud.</li>
        <li>HPE Distributed Virtual Routing and Switching (VRS): The HPE VRS is the software agent
          that runs in each Hypervisor (HV). The HPE VRS component is an enhanced Open vSwitch (OVS)
          implementation that constitutes the network forwarding plane.</li>
      </ul><p>During the installation, you will be interacting with DCN. You should be familiar with
        the major DCN components, including how to access the various systems, IP addresses, and
        user credentials. </p></section>
