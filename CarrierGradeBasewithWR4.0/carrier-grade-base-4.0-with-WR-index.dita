    <p>HPE Helion OpenStack Carrier Grade 4.0 is a carrier-grade distribution of OpenStack, the
      leading open source cloud computing platform.</p>
    <p>HPE Helion OpenStack Carrier Grade provides communications service providers (CSPs) with an
      open source based cloud platform that meets their demanding reliability requirements.</p>
    <section>The following documentation has been organized to help you locate information for
      specific types of activities, such as installation, administration, operations, and VNF
      integration. It further provides guidelines and rules to assist the cloud architects,
      installers, and administrators in deploying the HPE Helion OpenStack Carrier Grade (HCG)
      4.0.</section>
    <section id="installing-hp-openstack-carrier-grade"><title>Installing HPE Helion OpenStack
        Carrier Grade 4.0</title>This section describes various installation options that are
      available with HCG 4.0. Irrespective of any option that you select, to install HCG 4.0
      successfully, you need to perform three important steps. Failure to follow these
      recommendations will likely compromise reliability and performance:<p>
