<p>A port is a connection point for attaching a single device, such as the NIC of a virtual server, to a virtual network. You can configure rich network topologies by creating and configuring networks and subnets, and then instructing other OpenStack services like Compute to attach virtual devices to ports on these networks.</p>
<p>As an admin you can add ports to an existing subnet. Non-admin users can create subnets, but cannot create ports.</p>
<p>You can edit the device associated with a port and change the admin state, as needed.</p>
<p>As an admin, you can:</p>
