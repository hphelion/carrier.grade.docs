  <p ixia_locid="4">This enables you to verify that a provider network is configured correctly
   before launching VMs on the network.</p>
  <p ixia_locid="5">Audits run both periodically, and when triggered by provider network or host
   events, in order to test the connectivity over each network segment. They can also be manually
   requested using the CLI. </p>
  <p ixia_locid="6">The tests for each network type are as follows:</p>
  <ul id="ul_nlc_dqy_pv">
   <li ixia_locid="7">
    <p ixia_locid="8">Flat: Ping between compute nodes on the network.</p>
   </li>
   <li ixia_locid="9">
    <p ixia_locid="10">VLAN: Ping between compute nodes over each VLAN segment assigned to the
     provider network.</p>
   </li>
   <li ixia_locid="11">
    <p ixia_locid="12">VXLAN: Ping for each segmentation range assigned to the provider network.</p>
   </li>
  </ul>
  <p ixia_locid="13">For each individual test, one ping is sent with a size of 64 bytes, and another is sent with
   the MTU of the provider network. Each of those pings is sent from each node to 2 elected masters,
   and the results are reported to neutron-server.</p>
  <p ixia_locid="15">If a failure occurs on an audit run, an alarm is raised with details of the
   provider network connectivity failure. </p>
