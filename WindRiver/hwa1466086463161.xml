 <title ixia_locid="1">Accessing the Metadata Server</title>
 <shortdesc ixia_locid="2">When an instance is launched, it has the option to retrieve
  instance-specific and user data from a metadata server, which can be accessed using the well-known
  address 169.254.169.254. </shortdesc>

   <p ixia_locid="63"> The method used to access the server depends on your deployment scenario.</p>
   <ul id="ul_wg3_c5s_25">
    <li ixia_locid="79">
     <p ixia_locid="81">If the VM is attached to a tenant network with a virtual router then the
      metadata server is reachable using the virtual router as the route gateway. </p>
    </li>
    <li ixia_locid="80">
     <p ixia_locid="82">If the VM instance is attached to multiple tenant networks, each with access
      to a virtual router, then any of the virtual routers provides access to the metadata server.
      However, installing multiple default routes on the VM might impact the VM's ability to route
      packets back to external networks.</p>
    </li>
    <li ixia_locid="66">
     <p ixia_locid="67">If the VM is attached to a tenant network that does not have a virtual
      router then the a route to the metadata server can be retrieved from the Neutron DHCP service,
      provided that this service is enabled. If DHCP is enabled on a tenant network, then the VM can
      use DHCP option 121, Classless Static Route, to retrieve the metadata server static route
      information, which uses the DHCP server's address as the gateway.</p>
     <p ixia_locid="68">Note that when using DHCP option 121, the answer from the DHCP server will
      also include other applicable static routes. They include: </p>
     <ul id="ul_l14_2vh_f5">
      <li ixia_locid="83">
       <p ixia_locid="84">any static routes configured when the IP subnet was created</p>
      </li>
      <li ixia_locid="85">
       <p ixia_locid="86">default route to the subnet gateway IP address, if one is configured on
        the subnet </p>
      </li>
      <li ixia_locid="87">
       <p ixia_locid="88">on-link routes for all other subnets on the same network and same guest
        VLAN</p>
      </li>
     </ul>
    </li>
   </ul>
   <p ixia_locid="77"> The DHCP service only responds to option 121 is there are no virtual routers
    on the network.</p>
   <p ixia_locid="78">The following requirements must be satisfied in order for a guest application
    to access the metadata service:</p>
   <ul id="ul_dyn_vbd_sp">
    <li ixia_locid="45">
     <p ixia_locid="47">There is a route table entry to route traffic destined to the
      169.254.169.254 address via a Neutron router, or via a suitable static route to the
      169.254.169.254 address.</p>
    </li>
    <li ixia_locid="48">
     <p ixia_locid="49">The metadata server knows about the virtual machine instance associated with
      the MAC and IP addresses of the virtual Ethernet interface issuing the metadata service
      request. This is necessary for the metadata server to be able to validate the request, and to
      identify the virtual machine's specific data to be returned.</p>
     <p ixia_locid="50">On system managed subnets, the Neutron service has all address information
      associated with the virtual machines in its database.</p>
     <p ixia_locid="51">On unmanaged subnets, you must tell the Neutron service the IP address of
      the network interface issuing the metadata service requests. This can only be done using the
      command line or API interfaces when instantiating the virtual machine, as illustrated
      below:</p>
     <codeblock ixia_locid="52"><systemoutput ixia_locid="53">$ </systemoutput><userinput ixia_locid="54">nova boot \
--nic net-id=<varname ixia_locid="55">net-uuid</varname>,vif-model=avp,v4-fixed-ip=172.18.0.1 \
my-new-vm</userinput></codeblock>
     <p ixia_locid="56">In this simplified example, the option <option ixia_locid="57">v4-fixed-ip</option> tells Neutron what the IP address for this interface should be. The
      interface's MAC address is automatically generated by Nova.</p>
