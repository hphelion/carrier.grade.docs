  <p ixia_locid="4">Server Group Messaging is a service to provide simple, low-bandwidth datagram
   messaging and notifications for servers that are part of the same server group. This messaging
   channel is available regardless of whether IP networking is functional within the server, and it
   requires no knowledge within the server about the other members of the group. The service
   provides three types of messaging:</p>
  <ul id="ul_ipy_xjd_lr">
   <li ixia_locid="5">
    <p ixia_locid="6">Broadcast: enables a server to send a datagram (up to 3050 bytes) to all other
     servers within the server group</p>
   </li>
   <li ixia_locid="7">
    <p ixia_locid="8">Notification: provides servers with information about changes to the state of
     other servers within the server group</p>
   </li>
   <li ixia_locid="9">
    <p ixia_locid="10">Status: enables a server to query the current state of all servers within the
     server group (including itself)</p>
   </li>
  </ul>
  <p ixia_locid="11">This service is not intended for high-bandwidth or low-latency operations. It
   is best-effort and not guaranteed. For improved reliability, applications should do end-to-end
   ACKs and retries.</p>
