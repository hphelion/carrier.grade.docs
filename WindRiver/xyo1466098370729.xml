  <draft-comment author="psanchez" ixia_locid="4">[pedro] Other than the documentation on the SDK
   doc, there is no detailed work flow in the TIS docs about setting up the AVP-KMOD and AVP-PMD
   interfaces.</draft-comment>
  <draft-comment author="psanchez" ixia_locid="5">[pedro] For detailed information on this topic we
   would need to extract the content from the SDK README files and make it available into this
   document.</draft-comment>
  <p ixia_locid="6">Titanium Server AVP virtual NIC is a shared memory based high performance
   networking device. Its potential maximum throughput is higher than other emulated virtual NIC
   devices (for example, e1000). </p>
  <p ixia_locid="7">Titanium Server AVP Linux kernel device driver is delivered as source with the required
   makefiles in a compressed tarball, such that it can be compiled as an external kernel module.</p>
