        volume creation) and guest disk throughput. </shortdesc><prolog><author ixia_locid="3">Craig Griffin</author></prolog><conbody><p ixia_locid="4">The following figure provides VM boot time data from local storage for two compute
            nodes with 10K RPM SAS and booting a CentOS 7 image. The compute node was configured to
            boot from the CoW image. The results are the same when the image is expanded to 10 GB,
            20GB, or 40 GB. As shown, boot times for local storage VMs increase linearly with the
            number of VMs. The time can be impacted by the image size and by how many compute nodes
            the load is spread across (there were two nodes in this configuration). SSD disks are
            highly recommended for best boot times and if multiple VMs are being launched
            simultaneously. Use of LVM storage backing instead of image storage backing will
            significantly increase the boot times (and delete times) for large volumes, for example
            10 GB or larger.</p><fig id="fig_N1001C_N10016_N10001" ixia_locid="5"><title id="title__Toc441623500" ixia_locid="6">VM Create Times for Local Storage â€“ SAS Disks on

            the compute node storage. Use of local storage for VMs is recommended for VMs that have
            high rates of disk storage access and do not require remote storage because the storage
            access is local to the compute node. LVM backing storage may also provide better
            performance than image backing storage, although image backing storage improves over
            time for long-lived VMs. SSD storage for the secondary disk provides significantly
            better throughput than SAS disks. Storage QoS is recommended to better guarantee
            predictable performance.</p></conbody></concept-wr>
