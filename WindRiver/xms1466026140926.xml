  <p ixia_locid="4">By default, the internal management network is used for PXE booting of new
   hosts, and therefore must be untagged. It is also limited to IPv4, because the Titanium Server
   installer does not support IPv6 UEFI booting. If, for deployment reasons, the internal management
   network needs to be on a VLAN-tagged network, or if it must support IPv6, you can configure the
   optional untagged PXE boot network for PXE booting of new hosts using IPv4. </p>
