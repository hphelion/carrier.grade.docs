            Virtualization cloud solution capable of meeting demanding customer requirements for
            scalability, performance, capacity, and availability. It is not a one-size-fits-all
            solution, but a highly flexible framework that supports a range of deployment models,
            types and quantities of hardware, and tunable parameters to enable an optimized
            deployment for varying customer requirements. </shortdesc>
        <p id="TiS_advantages" ixia_locid="3">Titanium Server brings together the flexibility and
            scalability of the IT cloud and the high availability and performance demanded by the
            Telecommunications industry to deliver a unique carrier-grade, industry-leading solution
            at a price-performance ratio well above alternative solutions. Titanium Server is

            system parameters to assist cloud architects, installers, and administrators in
            deploying and scaling the Titanium Server system to meet application-specific
            requirements. Failure to follow these recommendations, guidelines and engineering rules
            will result in unknown performance trade-offs likely compromising reliability and
