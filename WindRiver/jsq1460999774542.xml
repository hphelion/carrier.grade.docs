  <p ixia_locid="367">In the Titanium Server CPE (Customer Premises Equipment) solution, each node
   implements controller, storage, and compute functions, and provides virtual machine hosting. This
   provides an ideal system for consolidating a small set of standalone server-based products, which
   may have various operating systems, networking requirements, and so on, into a simple and compact
   physical solution that offers ease of deployment, high availability, resource autoscaling, and
   other benefits of a cloud implementation.</p>
