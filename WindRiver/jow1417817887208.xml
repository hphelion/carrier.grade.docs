  <p ixia_locid="19"><draft-comment author="jowens" ixia_locid="22">US64370 update for CPU Threads
    Policy consideration</draft-comment>You can enable CPU scaling for an instance by setting a
   scaling range (see <xref href="jow1417817540528.xml" ixia_locid="20"/>). In addition, the
    <nameliteral ixia_locid="25">CPU Policy</nameliteral> must be set to <option ixia_locid="26">Dedicated</option>, and if the <nameliteral ixia_locid="23">CPU Thread Policy</nameliteral> is
   also present, it must be set to <option ixia_locid="24">Isolate</option> (see <xref href="jow1448561585231.xml" ixia_locid="21"/>).</p>
  <p ixia_locid="4">When an instance is first started, all available vCPUs are brought online. If
   the instance is restarted, the number of online vCPUs is set to match the number when the
   instance was stopped. This is controlled by a helper script that automatically takes the required
   number of vCPUs offline.</p>
  <p ixia_locid="17">When CPU resources are scaled up, a vCPU is brought online from the pool of
   available vCPUs for the instance, subject to the maximum allowed by the flavor. The
   lowest-numbered offline vCPU is selected.</p>
  <p ixia_locid="11">When CPU resources are scaled down, a vCPU is taken offline, subject to the
   minimum allowed by the flavor. By default, the highest-numbered online vCPU is selected. This can
   be overridden using the App Scale Helper script. </p>
  <p ixia_locid="18">For more about CPU scaling, refer to the documentation for the Titanium Server
   Software Development Kit.</p>

   <p ixia_locid="15">If there are insufficient resources to launch a scalable VM with the expected allotment when
    the VM is started or restarted, the launch fails. The VM is <i ixia_locid="16">not</i> automatically scaled down
    to compensate.</p>
