  <p ixia_locid="4"><draft-comment author="jowens" ixia_locid="5">US84057 new
   topic</draft-comment>Titanium Server can be configured to use SDN as an alternate backend for
   Neutron networking. An SDN-specific Neutron plugin uses SDN contoller northbound APIs to send
   Neutron tenant networking configurations to an OpenStack / Neutron integration application
   running on a remote SDN controller. The SDN controller implements the tenant networking by using
   OSVDB and OpenFlow interfaces to send switch configuration and flow rules to the accelerated
   vSwitches (AVS) on Titanium Server compute nodes.</p>
  <p ixia_locid="6">When enabled, the SDN controller manages Neutron L2 services and optionally L3
   services. If the option for the SDN controller to manage L3 services is not enabled, then L3
   services are managed locally.</p>
  <p ixia_locid="53">This feature is provided for demonstration purposes. For more about Titanium
   Server and SDN, refer to the <cite ixia_locid="54">Titanium Server Release Notes</cite>.</p>

   <p ixia_locid="51">SDN interoperability is configurable during system installation only. It
    cannot be added or removed after installation.</p>
