            <p ixia_locid="83">Unlike Cinder-based storage, ephemeral storage does not persist if
                the instance is terminated or the compute node fails.</p>
            <p id="local-storage-cold-migration" ixia_locid="88">In addition, for local ephemeral
                storage, migration and resizing support depends on the storage backing type
                specified for the instance, as well as the boot source selected at launch.</p>
