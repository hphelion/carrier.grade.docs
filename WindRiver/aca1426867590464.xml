  <p ixia_locid="4">Currently, only scaling the number of online guest vCPUs is supported. The
   resources can be scaled up or down from the Nova CLI or the Titanium Server web administration
   interface. Scaling can also be set up using Heat to be automatically triggered based on
   Ceilometer statistics. This package contains an agent and APIs for integration with the Titanium
   Server Scale Up / Down service. These will handle the guest side of the coordinated efforts
   involved in scaling up and down guest resources.</p>
