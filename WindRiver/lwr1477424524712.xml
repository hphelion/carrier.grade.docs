  <p ixia_locid="4">Software upgrades move Titanium Server software from one release to the next and
   change the version of updated software components. The upgrade typically updates components that
   may include the kernel, Operating System packages, OpenStack, and Titanium Server specific
   software. The software upgrade process manages several complexities such as conversion of
   database schemas, conversion of database data, API compatibility management between Titanium
   Server Hosts, and live migrating of hosted VMs.</p>
