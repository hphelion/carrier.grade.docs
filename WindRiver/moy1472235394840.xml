  <p ixia_locid="4">There are two cases for aborting an upgrade: </p>
  <ul id="ul_q5f_vmz_bx">
   <li ixia_locid="5">
    <p ixia_locid="6">Before controller-0 has been upgraded (that is, only controller-1 has been upgraded): In this
     case the upgrade can be aborted and the system will remain in service during the abort. </p>
   </li>
   <li ixia_locid="7">
    <p ixia_locid="8">After controller-0 has been upgraded (that is, both controllers have been upgraded): In this
     case the upgrade can only be aborted with a complete outage and a re-install of all hosts. This
     would only be done as a last resort, if there was absolutely no other way to recover the
     system. </p>
