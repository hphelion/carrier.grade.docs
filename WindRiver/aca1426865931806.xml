  <p ixia_locid="4">The Titanium Server AVP virtual network interface card (NIC) is a shared,
   memory-based, high-performance networking device. Its potential maximum throughput is higher than
   emulated virtual NIC devices (for example, e1000). This package provides the AVP Linux kernel
   device driver source. It can be compiled against most recent Linux kernel distributions.</p>
  <p ixia_locid="5">The Titanium Server AVP Linux kernel device driver is delivered as source with
   the required makefiles in a compressed tarball so that it can be compiled for the applicable
   guest Linux distribution as an external kernel module.</p>
