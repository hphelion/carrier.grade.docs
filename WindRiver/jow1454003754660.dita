                                    deployed across the two storage nodes, with each OSD consisting
                                    of a single physical disk, and an equal number of OSDs on each
                                    storage node to provide redundancy. The quantity of OSDs, the
                                    disk specifications (size, speed, technology), and the disk
                                    controller specifications all contribute to the performance and
                                    capacity of Cinder and Glance storage. This section provides
                                    some data and guidelines for engineering the OSD cluster.</p></conbody></concept-wr>
