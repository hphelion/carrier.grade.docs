  <p ixia_locid="5">Patch orchestration can be configured and run through the CLI, the Horizon GUI
   or the VIM REST API.</p>
  <p ixia_locid="6">Patch orchestration will automatically iterate through all nodes of the system and install the
   applied patch(es) to each node; first the Controller Nodes, then the Storage Nodes and finally
   the Compute Nodes. During the patching of Compute Nodes, the migration of VMs off of Compute
   Nodes being patched, is managed automatically by Patch Orchestration. The Controller Nodes are
   always patched in serial, however the Storage Nodes and Compute Nodes can configurably be patched
   in parallel in order to reduce the overall time of installing the patch.</p>
  <p ixia_locid="7"> Patch orchestration can install 1 or more applied patches at the same time, and can install
   Reboot-Required Patches and/or In-Service Patches at the same time. Patch orchestration will only
   lock/unlock (that is, reboot) a node to install a patch if at least 1 Reboot-Required patch has
   been applied. </p>
