    <!--NOTE: This caution, used in multiple topics in the Titanium Server Administration Guide, contains a cross-reference to a topic in the Titanium server Administration Guide that addresses an issue common to all of them. 

Cross references in referable content are normally discouraged, in part because they limit the applicability of the RC, but more practically because they can generate a terrifyingly complex trail of errors in the CMS if the target is removed and the map fails to validate.  

In this case, however, an embedded xref seems like the only reasonable option.-->

                is required for each virtual NUMA node in the instance. If this requirement cannot
                be met, the instantiation fails. For more information, see <ph ixia_locid="5" otherprops="printonly"><cite ixia_locid="6">Titanium Server Cloud Operation: </cite></ph><cite ixia_locid="7"><ph ixia_locid="8"><xref href="ilv1467810214383.xml" ixia_locid="9"/></ph></cite>.</p>
