  <p ixia_locid="4">Titanium Server Guest Heartbeat is a service to monitor the health of guest
   applications within a VM running under the Wind River Titanium Server. Loss of heartbeat will
   result in a specified corrective action (for example, rebooting the VM). Guest applications are
   given the opportunity to receive notification of, or even veto, actions affecting the VM. Guest
   applications can use this capability to cleanly shut down or even live migrate their service to a
   peer VM.</p>
