   Party OpenStack Cloud. Note that the installation must meet the requirements given in <xref href="ach1469625944660.xml" ixia_locid="60"/>. </p>
  <p ixia_locid="51">The third-party OpenStack Primary Region’s Keystone service must be configured
   with a tenant, users, services, and service endpoints (public, internal, and admin URLs) for both
   the third-party OS Primary Region services and each of the Titanium Server Secondary Region
   services. </p>

   Region’s Keystone through the <cmdname ixia_locid="54">config_region</cmdname> script and the
   INI-formatted region config file. For details on data filling the region config file (which
   includes the Titanium Server Secondary Region’s service access and endpoint data to be configured
   in the Primary Region), refer to the <filepath ixia_locid="10">REGION_CONFIG_DATA.xslx</filepath>
