            physical ports per compute node. A physical port is a physical NIC assigned as a data
            interface to the compute node. A virtual port can be a vNIC that has been assigned to a
            guest or a host port that is used to terminate tenant networks for hosting a virtual
            router or DHCP server. Therefore the number of virtual ports used by an AVS instance is
            dependent on the number of networks and VMs scheduled on a particular compute node.</p></conbody></concept-wr>
