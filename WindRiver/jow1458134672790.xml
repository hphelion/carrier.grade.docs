                discrepancy (greater than 1000 seconds, or about 17 minutes) develops between the
                clock time on a host and the time as reported by an NTP server, the
                    <nameliteral ixia_locid="7">ntpd</nameliteral> service on the host stops, and Alarm 200.006
                (&lt;hostname&gt; 'ntpd' process has failed) is logged in the Alarm Log and the
                Customer Log. This can occur if the clock on the host is inadvertently set
                incorrectly, or cannot access the NTP server for the correct time at initialization
                and defaults to an incorrect time. </p>
            <p ixia_locid="8">To recover, lock and then unlock the host. The time is automatically synchronized to
                the NTP server when the host is unlocked.</p>
