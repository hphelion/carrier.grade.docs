              consolidates historical alarms that have been raised in the past, including those that
              have been cleared, as well as logs that do not require user action, but may provide
              useful information for fault management. </p>
            <p ixia_locid="34">Certain system events that do not result in node state changes and
              typically do not require immediate customer action, such as instance deletions or
              failed migration attempts, are recorded in customer logs. Each log describes a single
              event. The logs are displayed in a list, along with summary information. For each
              individual log, you can view detailed information. </p>
            <p ixia_locid="35">Logs and historical alarms are held in a buffer, with older entries
              discarded as needed to release logging space.</p>
