 <title ixia_locid="1">PCI Passthrough Ethernet Interfaces</title>
 <shortdesc ixia_locid="2">A passthrough Ethernet interface is a physical PCI Ethernet NIC on a
  compute node to which a virtual machine is granted direct access. </shortdesc>

  <p ixia_locid="13">This minimizes packet processing delays but at the same time demands special operational
   considerations.  </p>
  <p ixia_locid="6">For all purposes, a PCI passthrough interface behaves as if it were physically
   attached to the virtual machine. Therefore, any potential throughput limitations coming from the
   virtualized environment, such as the ones introduced by internal copying of data buffers, are
   eliminated. However, by bypassing the virtualized environment, the use of PCI passthrough
   Ethernet devices introduces several restrictions that you must take into consideration. They
   include:</p>

   <li ixia_locid="7">
    <p ixia_locid="8">no support for LAG, QoS, ACL, or host interface monitoring</p>
   </li>
   <li ixia_locid="9">
    <p ixia_locid="10">no support for live migration</p>
   </li>
   <li ixia_locid="11">
    <p ixia_locid="12">no access to the compute node's AVS switch</p>
