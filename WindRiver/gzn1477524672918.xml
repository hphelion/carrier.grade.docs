 <title ixia_locid="1">Performance Enhanced Standard virtio - Support for vhost-net/vhost-user </title>
 <shortdesc ixia_locid="2">Unmodified guests can use Linux networking and virtio drivers. This
  provides a mechanism to bring existing applications into the production environment
  immediately.</shortdesc>

  <p ixia_locid="4">For virtio interfaces, Titanium Server supports vhost-user transparently by
   default. This allows QEMU and AVS to share virtio queues through shared memory, resulting in
   improved performance over standard virtio. The transparent implementation provides a simplified
   alternative to the open-source AVP kernel and AVP-PMD drivers included with Titanium Server. The
   availability of vhost-user also offers additional performance enhancements through optional
   multi-queue support for virtio interfaces.</p>
  <p ixia_locid="5">For backwards compatibility, Guest OS can still be configured to leverage the
   open-sourceAccelerated Virtual Port (AVP-KMOD) drivers available at
   https://github.com/Wind-River/titanium-server. </p>
