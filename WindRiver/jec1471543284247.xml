    comments.</draft-comment>A <term ixia_locid="57">region</term> is a discrete OpenStack
   environment with dedicated API endpoints that typically shares at least the Identity/Keystone
   service with other regions. Region configurations provide for the scalability of Titanium Server

   <p ixia_locid="15">This configuration provides for scalability. It enables you to scale the
    number of overall compute nodes to more than that supported by a single Titanium Server region,
    with some level of integration (through shared services) across all regions,<draft-comment author="jowens" ixia_locid="59">Craig adds:</draft-comment> and with separate Nova and Neutron
    domains for each region. </p>
   <p ixia_locid="17">As shown in <xref format="dita" href="#jec1471543284247/fig_q1q_tzp_kx" ixia_locid="61"/>, selected controller services are shared between regions. Shared central
    services provide multi-region-wide management capabilities. <draft-comment author="jowens" ixia_locid="60">Craig suggests as figure title, "Titanium Server Scalability Example with
