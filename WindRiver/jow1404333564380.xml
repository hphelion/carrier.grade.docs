        <p ixia_locid="55">Available networks include the PXE boot network, the internal management
            network, the OAM network, the infrastructure network, the board management network, and
            one or more provider networks.</p>
        <p ixia_locid="56">The internal management network is required by all systems for internal
            communication; the OAM network is required for external control access; and at least one
            provider network is required for use by VMs. The need for other networks is determined
            by the system configuration (CPE, standard with controller storage, or standard with
            dedicated storage), the number of hosts supported, the expected system loads, and the
            availability of features such as Integrated Lights Out (iLO) board management.</p>
        <p ixia_locid="57">You can optionally consolidate more than one network on a single physical interface.  For
            more information, see <xref href="jow1423173019489.xml" ixia_locid="58"/>.</p>
