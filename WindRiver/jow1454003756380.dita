            are the required capacity, I/O operations per second (IOPS), and data throughput. The
            deployment choices that contribute to these parameters are disk size, disk speed, disk
            controller performance, and the number of disks. Processor speed, cores, and memory may
            contribute but to a lesser degree.</p><p ixia_locid="5">In general, scaling the cluster by adding more OSDs is preferable to scaling through the use of larger or faster devices.  This is because adding OSDs not only increases capacity but also performance by providing more devices to spread reads and writes across.  The following sections provide guidance on selecting the number of OSDs for a specific hardware configuration.  </p></conbody></concept-wr>
