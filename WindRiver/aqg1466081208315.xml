 <title ixia_locid="1">SR-IOV Ethernet Interfaces</title>
 <shortdesc ixia_locid="2">A SR-IOV Ethernet interface is a physical PCI Ethernet NIC that
  implements hardware-based virtualization mechanisms to expose multiple virtual network interfaces
  that can be used by one or more virtual machines simultaneously.</shortdesc>

  <p ixia_locid="5">The PCI-SIG Single Root I/O Virtualization and Sharing (SR-IOV) specification
   defines a standardized mechanism to create individual virtual Ethernet devices from a single
   physical Ethernet interface. For each exposed virtual Ethernet device, formally referred to as a
    <term ixia_locid="116">Virtual Function</term> (VF), the SR-IOV interface provides separate
   management memory space, work queues, interrupts resources, and DMA streams, while utilizing
   common resources behind the host interface. Each VF therefore has direct access to the hardware
   and can be considered to be an independent Ethernet interface.</p>
