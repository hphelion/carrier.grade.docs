            mandatory. Faster SAS disks, such as 15K RPM SAS or SSDs are recommended. Two to eight
            OSDs per storage node (4 to 16 OSDs total) are currently supported.</p><p ixia_locid="5">SSD OSDs are highly recommended for more disk throughput, especially for VM disk
            operations with many VMs writing in parallel or if VMs have high disk throughput. An
            aggregate of 2000 IOPS and 200 MB/sec throughput (as measured by an IOPS tool executing
            random reads) for all VMs is a recommended point where using SSDs instead of SAS disks
            should be considered.</p></conbody></concept-wr>
