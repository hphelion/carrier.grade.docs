   <draft-comment author="eknowlto" ixia_locid="90">CGTS-4255</draft-comment>
   <p ixia_locid="91">To enable secure HTTPS access for REST API applications and the web server, a
    digital certificate is required during software installation. When secure HTTPS connectivity is
    chosen, HTTP is disabled.</p>
   <p ixia_locid="92">The use of a CA-signed certificate is strongly recommended. However, for
    evaluation purposes, you have the option to select a self-signed certificate included with
    Titanium Server. You must obtain the certificate and copy it to the controller host before
    starting the controller configuration script. You can update the certificate at any time after
    installation.</p>

   <title ixia_locid="49">Installing a digital certificate</title>
   <p ixia_locid="33">To install a CA-signed digital certificate, follow the procedure for
    installing and configuring the Titanium Server system. During this procedure, you must copy the
    certificate PEM file to a designated license directory on the controller host. The default
    designated directory is <filepath ixia_locid="35">/home/wrsroot</filepath>; you can specify a
    different one during installation.</p>

   <title ixia_locid="55">Updating a digital certificate</title>
   <p ixia_locid="37">After you have installed a digital certificate, whether CA-signed or
    self-signed, you can update it by copying the new certificate to the designated directory on the
    active controller host, and then running the <cmdname ixia_locid="39">https-certificate-install</cmdname> utility as shown in the following example.</p>
