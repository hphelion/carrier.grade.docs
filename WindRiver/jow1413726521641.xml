 <title ixia_locid="1">System Configuration Management Overview</title>
 <shortdesc ixia_locid="2">Much of the system configuration data is specified as bootstrap-type
  configuration data defined during software installation, using the <nameliteral ixia_locid="5">config_controller</nameliteral> script. After installation, you can change this system
  configuration data, as well as additional system configuration data, using the web administration
  interface or the CLI.</shortdesc>

  <p ixia_locid="60">There are a few exceptions to bootstrap system configuration data, specified at install time,
   that can NOT be changed afterwards; one should ensure these configurations are correct otherwise
   a system re-install is required. This configuration data includes: product type (Standard vs
   CPE), presence of a pxeboot network, management network subnet and subnet range, infrastructure
   network subnet and subnet range, and use of secure external connections.</p>
