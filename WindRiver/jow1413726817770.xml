  <p ixia_locid="21">Configuration changes require multiple hosts to be reconfigured, during which
   the settings across the cluster are not consistent. This causes alarms to be raised for the
   system.</p>
  <ul id="ul_uyz_tt5_4q">
   <li ixia_locid="24">
    <p ixia_locid="22">Changes to the DNS server configuration cause transitory alarms. These alarms
     are cleared automatically when the configuration change is applied.</p>
   </li>
   <li ixia_locid="25">
    <p ixia_locid="23">Changes to the External OAM network IP addresses or NTP server addresses, and
     in particular to the controller storage allotments, cause persistent alarms. These alarms must
     be cleared manually, by locking and unlocking the affected hosts or performing other
     administrative actions.</p>
   </li>
  </ul>
  <p ixia_locid="5">Alarms appear on the <wintitle ixia_locid="18">Fault Management</wintitle> page,
   and related status messages appear on the <wintitle ixia_locid="19">Hosts</wintitle> tab on the
    <wintitle ixia_locid="20">Host Inventory</wintitle> page. A variety of alarms can be reported on
   the <wintitle ixia_locid="26">Fault Management</wintitle> page, depending on the configuration
   change.</p>

   <p ixia_locid="17">To help identify alarms raised during a configuration change, ensure that any existing system
    alarms are cleared before you begin. </p>

  <p ixia_locid="14">On the <wintitle ixia_locid="8">Hosts</wintitle> tab of the <wintitle ixia_locid="9">Host Inventory</wintitle> page, the status <nameliteral ixia_locid="15">Config out-of-date</nameliteral> is shown for hosts affected by the change. Each host with
      this status must be locked and then unlocked to update its configuration and clear the
      alarm.</p>
