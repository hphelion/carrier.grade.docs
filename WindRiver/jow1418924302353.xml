                    <p ixia_locid="865">Wind River recommends that you delete the host and
                        re-install it to ensure that any resource changes, such as device name
                        reassignments, are correctly recorded in the inventory.</p>

                        <p ixia_locid="858">Ensure that the host is <nameliteral ixia_locid="859">Online</nameliteral>, so that its disk is erased when it is deleted
                            from the inventory. This ensures that the host boots from the network
                            when it is powered up for re-installation. If the host is not online
                            when it is deleted from the inventory, then during re-installation you
                            may need to force a network boot.</p>
