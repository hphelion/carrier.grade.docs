  <!--<section><title>Guest Heartbeat</title><p>Titanium Server Guest-Client provides a heartbeat service to monitor the health of guest application(s) within a VM running under Wind River's Titanium Server. Loss of heartbeat will result in a corrective action being taken against the VM. The heartbeat interval and corrective action is specified by the VM. Titanium Server Guest-Client also provides guest application(s) within a VM running under Wind River's Titanium Server, the ability to receive notification of and vote to accept or reject actions about to be performed against the VM. On notifications, the guest application within the VM can take this opportunity to cleanly shut down or transfer its service to a peer VM. </p></section>-->
