 <title ixia_locid="1">Guest VLANs</title>
 <shortdesc ixia_locid="2"><draft-comment author="jmaran" ixia_locid="49">This is a lot for a short description.
   Perhaps just move the second sentence into the body text. Or perhaps omit the "Together with the
   capability to define multiple IP subnets on a single tenant network" and explain that
   elsewhere.</draft-comment>Use guest VLANs to segregate IP traffic from a single virtual Ethernet
  interface on a virtual machine into dedicated VLANs. Together with the capability to define
  multiple IP subnets on a single tenant network, guest VLANs facilitate the transitioning of
  existing guest applications to run on the Titanium Server virtualized network
  environment.</shortdesc>

  <p ixia_locid="4">Guest VLANs are useful when guest applications rely on the capability to
   configure a single virtual Ethernet interface with multiple, probably overlapping, IP addresses.
   From the point of view of the guest, this is done by defining VLAN Ethernet interfaces, and
   associating one or more IP addresses to them. If implementing overlapping IP addresses, typically
   in support of VPN applications, the guest must use different VLAN IDs to separate traffic from
   different VPNs.</p>
  <p ixia_locid="5">For example, on a Linux guest, the virtual interfaces eth0.10:1, eth0.10:2, and
   eth0.20 refer to the same eth0 physical interface with two virtual interfaces on VLAN ID 10, and
   a single virtual interface on VLAN ID 20. A common scenario in a VLAN application is to allocate
   distinct IP addresses from the same IP subnet to virtual interfaces on the same VLAN. In this
   example, eth0.10:1 and eth0.10:2 could be assigned distinct IP addresses from the subnet
   192.168.1.0/24, and eth0.20 an address from the subnet 192.168.2.0/24. In the case of a VPN
   application, overlapping IP addresses are allowed to exist on eth0.20 and either eth0.10:1 or
   eth0.10:2.</p>
  <p ixia_locid="6">Titanium Server supports these deployment scenarios with the help of guest VLANs
   which enable the transport of IP subnets traffic over VLAN-tagged Ethernet frames. To support the
   example above, a tenant user would define the following two IP subnets, both on the same tenant
   network, using guest VLAN IDs as follows:</p>
  <ul id="ul_jn2_rdw_pr">
   <li ixia_locid="7">
    <p ixia_locid="8">Subnet 192.168.1.0/24 with guest VLAN ID set to 10</p>
   </li>
   <li ixia_locid="9">
    <p ixia_locid="10">Subnet 192.168.2.0/24 with guest VLAN ID set to 20</p>
   </li>
  </ul>
  <p ixia_locid="11">The subnet-to-VLAN_ID mapping can be one-to-one, as in this example, or
   many-to-one. This means that tenant users can use a single VLAN ID of their choice to encapsulate
   traffic from one or more IP subnets.</p>
  <p ixia_locid="47">Alternately, tenant networks can be configured to use VLAN Transparent mode, in
   which VLAN tagged guest packets are encapsulated within a provider network segment without
   removing or modifying the guest VLAN tag. <draft-comment author="jmaran" ixia_locid="50">Another
    xref that is local in the Tenant User's Guide and Cloud Admin guide but inter-book for the
    planning guide. Leaving in local format. â€“ JM: Reversed decision due to unusable link in
    planning guide. Changed to inter-book format.</draft-comment>For more information, see <ph ixia_locid="51" otherprops="printonly"><cite ixia_locid="52">Titanium Server Tenant User's

   <title ixia_locid="29">Guest VLAN Implementation</title>
   <p ixia_locid="30">Guest VLANs are implemented using available segmentation ranges from suitable provider
    networks, just as it is done when new tenant networks are created. Therefore all network design
    considerations regarding the configuration of L2 switches and the Neutron allocation strategy,
    described in <xref href="jow1404333739174.xml" ixia_locid="31"/>, must be taken into consideration.</p>
   <p ixia_locid="32">Additionally, note that the AVS will silently discard incoming VLAN-tagged VM traffic with
    unknown VLAN IDs, that is, with VLAN IDs not defined as guest VLANs on the particular tenant
    network.</p>
