  <p ixia_locid="27">There are no specific requirements for network services to be available on the
   provider network. However, you must ensure that all network services required by the guests
   running in the compute nodes are available. For configuration purposes, the compute nodes
   themselves are entirely served by the services provided by the controller nodes over the internal
   management network.</p>
