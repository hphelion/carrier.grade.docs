  <p ixia_locid="4">The Secondary Region includes all OpenStack Services supported by the particular
   OpenStack Cloud, except for those services that the Primary Region is sharing with this Secondary
   Region.</p>
  <p ixia_locid="44">The local services of the Secondary Region must be configured to obtain
   authenticated tokens and service endpoint URLs from the Primary Region Keystone service. The
   Primary Regionâ€™s Keystone service requires a tenant, users, services, and service endpoints for
   all services running in both regions.</p>

   <p ixia_locid="47">There are no edit/delete protections on the Keystone entities that are created
