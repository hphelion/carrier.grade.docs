  <p ixia_locid="4">Virtual networks, which include provider networks and tenant networks, are defined and
   implemented internally. They are connected to system hosts and to the outside world using
   physical networks attached to data interfaces on compute nodes. </p>
  <p ixia_locid="5">Each physical network supports one or more provider networks, which may be implemented as a
   flat, VLAN, or VXLAN network. The provider networks in turn support tenant networks, which are
   allocated for use by different tenants and their VMs, and which can be isolated from one another.
