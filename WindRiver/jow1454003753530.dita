The following management/infrastructure interface combinations are supported.  Link aggregation of all interfaces is recommended for high availability.</p>

        </ul><p ixia_locid="11">If the storage node supports a board management via an iLO management interface,
            the Board Management Controller (BMC) moduleâ€™s Ethernet port can be connected to a
            dedicated private network. For controller node communication with the BMC modules, a
            VLAN on the internal management logical interface is configured on the board management
            network. It is recommended, but not required, to use the OAM network for controller
            access to the board management network.</p></conbody></concept-wr>
