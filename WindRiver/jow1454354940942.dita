In addition, AVS supports a maximum of 256 network segments.  AVS will only populate active entries as it learns endpoints, therefore it is possible for a network segment to contain greater than 1024 connected devices as long as the single compute node is not actively communicating with all end-points simultaneously.  MAC entries are aged out after a fixed interval of 120 seconds of inactivity.</p></conbody></concept-wr>
