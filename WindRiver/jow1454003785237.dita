                                    Dedicated Storage. The Standard Configuration with Controller
                                    Storage limit is driven not by compute node complement, but by
                                    storage capacity, storage performance, and volume creation/boot
                                    times. In practice, 10 computes may be the practical limit for
                                    the Standard Configuration with Controller Storage.</p></conbody></concept-wr>
