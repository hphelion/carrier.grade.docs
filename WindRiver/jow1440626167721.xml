        belings in the System Admin Guide, as it's more about managing cloud network traffic. It's
        also more about deep troubleshooting.</draft-comment><draft-comment author="jowens" ixia_locid="5">US53369 topic added</draft-comment>In Titanium Server, an accelerated virtual
      switch (AVS) runs on each compute host, providing Layer 2 switching for the virtual machines
      instantiated on the host. Up to 254 ports are supported for each host; this total includes
      physical, guest, and host ports.</p>
  <p ixia_locid="9">You can use the <cmdname ixia_locid="6">vshell</cmdname> utility to query the
   status of each vSwitch and collect performance statistics. You can use the <cmdname ixia_locid="7">vtrace</cmdname> utility to perform packet trace operations.</p>
