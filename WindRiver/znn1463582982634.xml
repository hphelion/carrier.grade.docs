  <p ixia_locid="14">You should ensure that the following services are available on the OAM
   Network:</p>
  <dl>
   <dlentry ixia_locid="15">
    <dt ixia_locid="16">DNS Service</dt>
    <dd ixia_locid="17">
     <p ixia_locid="18">Needed to facilitate the name resolution of servers reachable on the OAM
      Network. </p>
     <p ixia_locid="19">Titanium Server can operate without a configured DNS service. However, a DNS
      service should be in place to ensure that links to external references in the current and
      future versions of the Web administration interface work as expected.</p>
    </dd>
   </dlentry>
   <dlentry ixia_locid="20">
    <dt ixia_locid="21">NTP Service</dt>
    <dd ixia_locid="22">
     <p ixia_locid="23">The Network Time Protocol (NTP) can be optionally used by the Titanium
      Server controller nodes to synchronize their local clocks with a reliable external time
      reference. However, Wind River strongly recommends that this service be available, among other
      things, to ensure that system-wide log reports present a unified view of the day-to-day
      operations.</p>
     <p ixia_locid="24">The Titanium Server compute nodes and storage nodes always use the
      controller nodes as the de-facto time server for the entire Titanium Server cluster. </p>
