        attachment and routing details are not beyond the scope of the documentation, we may want to
        recast this as a task with steps for establishing the connection.</draft-comment>For access
      to Swift storage, you must attach the VM to an external network with a route to the controller
      OAM network. The VM uses a Swift client or Swift REST API to manage Swift containers and
      objects, sending commands to the Titanium Server Swift endpoint public URL. The Swift API
      service on the Titanium Server controller has access to the Swift containers and objects in
      the Ceph storage pool over the infrastructure network.</p>
