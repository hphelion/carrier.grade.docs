  <p ixia_locid="156"> Software for the initial controller node is installed from a USB flash drive
   or PXE boot server, and configured for operation with a single script. Software for
   subsequent hosts is installed over the internal management network from the initial controller
   node, and configured using either the web administration interface, or the command line on the
   controller.</p>
  <p ixia_locid="157">This is in contrast with the installation and commissioning sequence of the
   open-source OpenStack, which involves the setup of numerous individual configuration files, the
   installation of various backends supporting OpenStack components, and the configuration of
   multiple Linux services and other open-source programs.</p>
  <p ixia_locid="358">Titanium Server also supports automated installation and commissioning using
   response files for initial configuration, and manifest files for bulk installation of subsequent
   hosts.</p>
