  <p ixia_locid="10">As with the internal management network, the infrastructure network must be
   implemented as a single, dedicated, Layer 2 broadcast domain for the exclusive use of each
   Titanium Server cluster. Sharing of this network by more than one Titanium Server cluster is only
   supported in a Multi-Region Configuration.</p>
  <p ixia_locid="11">The infrastructure network can be implemented as a 10 Gb Ethernet network. In
   its absence, all infrastructure traffic is carried over the internal management network.</p>
