            ingress and egress traffic. For a given port, 128 rules including both ingress and
            egress rules can be configured. In addition, each AVS instance supports a maximum of
            16384 rules in total. Increasing the number of security group rules for a given guest
            has a direct impact on performance; therefore it is recommended to use wildcard matching
            and port ranges whenever possible. In addition, security group rules are compressed;
            therefore rules that have overlapping match criteria (for example, address ranges), can
            be optimized to reduce the performance penalty for a larger number of rule sets.</p></conbody></concept-wr>
