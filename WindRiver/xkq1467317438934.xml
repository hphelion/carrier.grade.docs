    topic</draft-comment>Rotational disks on storage hosts are always assigned as object storage
   devices (OSDs) to provide storage for VM disks. Solid-state disks (SSDs) can be assigned as OSDs,
   or as <term ixia_locid="11">journal functions</term> to provide space for Ceph transaction journals associated
   with OSDs. </p>
  <p ixia_locid="12">On systems configured for cache tiering, the hosts in the caching tier always
   use SSDs for high performance. The SSDs in this tier must be assigned as OSDs; they cannot be
   used for journal functions.</p>
  <p ixia_locid="6">To assign storage-host disks as OSDs, see <xref href="zkn1464874715372.xml" ixia_locid="7"/>. To create SSD-backed journals, see <xref href="jra1467638430659.xml" ixia_locid="8"/>.</p>
