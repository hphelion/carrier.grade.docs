    <p>A virtual machine image is a single file that contains a virtual disk with a bootable
      operating system installed on it. You can use images to create virtual machine instances
      within the cloud.</p>
    <p>To create an image, you upload an ISO image file. After you upload an image, it is considered
      golden and you cannot change it.</p>
    <p>You can use the dashboards to create and configure private virtual machine images, which can
      be used to create instances.</p>

      <note> You can also <xref
        href="../Instances/CGH-2-User-Instance-snapshot-create.dita#topic1162">create an image based
        on an instance</xref>, which is called a <i>snapshot</i>.</note>
    <p>How you interact with these images depends upon your user type, either an administrative user
      (admin) or a non-administrative user (user).</p>
    
      <note> The admin can perform all of the user tasks in addition to the admin tasks.</note>

      <title>Managing images as a user</title>
      <p>As a user, you can work with any <i>private</i> images associated with the active

      <p>Access the admin image commands using the System Panel on the Admin dashboard.</p>
      <p>As an admin, you can determine if the snapshot is available only in the current project or
