        <p ixia_locid="24">You can review details for existing provider networks using the web administration
            interface or the CLI. For more information, see <xref href="jow1439301559036.xml" ixia_locid="25"/>.</p>
        <p ixia_locid="4">When planning provider networks, you must consider the following
            guidelines:</p>
        <ul id="ul_cmp_rl2_4n">
            <li ixia_locid="5">
                <p ixia_locid="6">From the point of view of the tenants, all networking happens over
                    the tenant networks created by them, or by the <nameliteral ixia_locid="7">admin</nameliteral> user on their behalf. Tenants are not necessarily aware
                    of the available provider networks. In fact, they cannot create tenant networks
                    over provider networks not already accessible to them. For this reason, the
                    system administrator must ensure that proper communication mechanisms are in
                    place for tenants to request access to specific provider networks when
                    required.</p>
                <p ixia_locid="8">For example, a tenant may be interested in creating a new tenant
                    network with access to a specific network access device in the data center, such
                    as an access point for a wireless transport. In this case, the system
                    administrator must create a new tenant network on behalf of the tenant, using a
                    VLAN ID in the provider network's segmentation range that provides connectivity
                    to the said network access point.</p>
            </li>
            <li ixia_locid="9">
                <p ixia_locid="10">Consider how different offerings of bandwidth, throughput
                    commitments, and class-of-service, can be used by your users. Having different
                    provider network offerings available to your tenants enables end users to
                    diversify their own portfolio of services. This in turn gives the 
                    administration an opportunity to put different revenue models in
                    place.</p>
            </li>
            <li ixia_locid="11">
                <p ixia_locid="12">For the IPv4 address plan, consider the following:</p>
                <ul id="ul_ixv_ct2_4n">
                    <li ixia_locid="13">
                        <p ixia_locid="14">Tenant networks attached to a public network, such as the
                            Internet, have to have external addresses assigned to them. Therefore
                            you must plan for valid definitions of their IPv4 subnets and default
                            gateways.</p>
                    </li>
                    <li ixia_locid="15">
                        <p ixia_locid="16">As with the OAM network, you must ensure that suitable
                            firewall services are in place on any tenant network with a public
                            address.</p>
                    </li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            <li ixia_locid="17">
                <p ixia_locid="18">Segmentation ranges defined on a provider network may be owned by
                    the administrator, a specific tenant, or may be shared by all tenants. With this
                    ownership model:</p>
                <ul id="ul_kgw_jdl_hp">
                    <li ixia_locid="19">
                        <p ixia_locid="20">A base deployment scenario has each compute node using a
                            single data interface defined over a single provider network. In this
                            scenario, all required tenant networks can be instantiated making use of
                            the available VLANs or VNIs in each corresponding segmentation range.
                            You may need more than one provider network when the underlying physical
                            networks demand different MTU sizes, or when boundaries between provider
                            networks are dictated by policy or other non-technical
                            considerations.</p>

                        <p ixia_locid="22">Segmentation ranges can be reserved and assigned
                            on-demand without having to lock and unlock the compute nodes. This
                            facilitates day-to-day operations which can be performed without any
                            disruption to the running environment.</p>

            <li ixia_locid="26">
                <p ixia_locid="27">In some circumstances, provider networks can be configured to
                    support VLAN Transparent mode on tenant networks. In this mode VLAN tagged
                    packets are encapsulated within a provider network segment without removing or
                    modifying the guest VLAN tag. For more information, see <xref href="rst1442341292102.xml" ixia_locid="28"/>.</p>
