    added</draft-comment>In HP Helion OpenStack Carrier Grade, an accelerated virtual switch (AVS) runs on each
   compute host, providing Layer 2 switching for the virtual machines instantiated on the host. Up
   to 254 ports are supported for each host; this total includes physical, guest, and host
   ports.</p>
  <p>You can use the <cmdname>vshell</cmdname> utility to query the
   status of each vSwitch and collect performance statistics. You can use the <cmdname>vtrace</cmdname> utility to perform packet trace operations.</p>
