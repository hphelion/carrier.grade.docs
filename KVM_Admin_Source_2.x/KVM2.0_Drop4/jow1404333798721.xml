        <p ixia_locid="21">Each of these groups is run in 1:1 HA mode by the controllers. This means that while some
      service groups can be active on controller-0, and in standby on controller-1, others are
      active on controller-1, and in standby on controller-0.</p>
        <p ixia_locid="22">The high-availability framework constantly monitors and reports on the health of the
      individual services within each of the service groups on both controllers. When a service
      fails, a decision is made on whether to restart it on the same controller, or to switch the
      corresponding service group to the other controller. This decision depends on the criticality
      and the dependencies of the affected service.</p>
        <p ixia_locid="23">For maintenance purposes, when one of the controller nodes needs to be powered down for
      service, it is necessary to force all currently active service groups in one controller to
      switch to the other. This can be done from the <uicontrol ixia_locid="24">Hosts</uicontrol> tab on the
        <wintitle ixia_locid="25">Inventory</wintitle> page, by selecting the option <option ixia_locid="26">swact</option> (switch
      active) in the <uicontrol ixia_locid="27">More</uicontrol> menu of the controller you want to take out of
      service.</p>

            <p ixia_locid="46">Services in the <nameliteral ixia_locid="47">Controller
                    Services</nameliteral> group drive core functionality in HP Helion OpenStack Carrier Grade. The
                controller where they are running is referred to as the <term ixia_locid="48">active</term> controller. The <uicontrol ixia_locid="49">Hosts</uicontrol> tab
                in the <wintitle ixia_locid="50">System Inventory</wintitle> page of the <uicontrol ixia_locid="51">Admin</uicontrol> panel lists the status of all hosts in the
                cluster; it reports the active controller as having the <term ixia_locid="52">Controller-Active</term> personality.</p>
            <p ixia_locid="53">When working from the CLI on a controller node it is often important
                to ensure that you are working on the active controller, for example, to execute
                OpenStack <nameliteral ixia_locid="62">admin</nameliteral> operations, or to change
                the password of the <nameliteral ixia_locid="54">wrsroot</nameliteral> user account.
                See <xref href="jow1404333563834.xml" ixia_locid="55"/> for further details on the
                    <nameliteral ixia_locid="56">wrsroot</nameliteral> account.</p>
            <p ixia_locid="61">You can ensure you are working on the active controller by using the
                OAM floating IP address as the destination address in the SSH command.</p>
