 <title>Host Status and Alarms During System Configuration Changes</title>

  while the system is in transition. You can use the information provided by these messages to help
  guide the transition successfully.</shortdesc>

 <conbody>
  <p>Configuration changes require multiple hosts to be reconfigured, during which
   the settings across the cluster are not consistent. This causes alarms to be raised for the
   system.</p>
  <ul id="ul_uyz_tt5_4q">
   <li>
    <p>Changes to the DNS server configuration cause transitory alarms. These alarms
     are cleared automatically when the configuration change is applied.</p>
   </li>
   <li>
    <p>Changes to the External OAM network IP addresses or NTP server addresses, and
     in particular to the controller storage allotments, cause persistent alarms. These alarms must
     be cleared manually, by locking and unlocking the affected hosts or performing other
     administrative actions.</p>
   </li>
  </ul>
  <p>Alarms appear on the <wintitle>Fault Management</wintitle> pane, and related
   status messages appear on the <wintitle>Hosts</wintitle> tab on the
    <wintitle>Inventory</wintitle> pane. A variety of alarms may be reported on the Fault Management
   page, depending on the configuration change.</p>
  <note id="note_N1002C_N1001F_N10001" type="caution">
   <p>To help identify alarms raised during a configuration change, ensure that any existing system
    alarms are cleared before you begin. </p>
  </note>
  <p>On the <wintitle>Hosts</wintitle> tab of the <wintitle>System Inventory</wintitle> pane, the status <nameliteral>Config
    out-of-date</nameliteral> is shown for hosts affected by the change.  Each host with this status
   must be locked and then unlocked to update its configuration and clear the alarm.</p>
