        <p ixia_locid="4" class="- topic/p ">When planning provider networks, you must consider the following
            guidelines:</p>
        <ul id="ul_cmp_rl2_4n" class="- topic/ul ">
            <li ixia_locid="5" class="- topic/li ">
                <p ixia_locid="6" class="- topic/p ">From the point of view of the tenants, all networking happens over
                    the tenant networks created by them, or by the <nameliteral ixia_locid="7" class="+ topic/ph hi-d/b wr-sw-d/nameliteral ">admin</nameliteral> user on their behalf. Tenants are not necessarily aware
                    of the available provider networks. In fact, they cannot create tenant networks
                    over provider networks not already accessible to them. For this reason, the
                    system administrator must ensure that proper communication mechanisms are in
                    place for tenants to request access to specific provider networks when
                    required.</p>
                <p ixia_locid="8" class="- topic/p ">For example, a tenant may be interested in creating a new tenant
                    network with access to a specific network access device in the data center, such
                    as an access point for a wireless transport. In this case, the system
                    administrator must create a new tenant network on behalf of the tenant, using a
                    VLAN ID in the provider network's segmentation range that provides connectivity
                    to the said network access point.</p>

                    commitments, and class-of-service, can be used by your users. Having different
                    provider network offerings available to your tenants enables end users to
                    diversify their own portfolio of services. This in turn gives the Titanium
                    Server administration an opportunity to put different revenue models in

                            you must plan for valid definitions of their IPv4 subnets and default
                            gateways.</p>

                            single data interface defined over a single provider network. In this
                            scenario, all required tenant networks can be instantiated making use of
                            the available VLANs or VNIs in each corresponding segmentation range.
                            You may need more than one provider network when the underlying physical
                            networks demand different MTU sizes, or when boundaries between provider
                            networks are dictated by policy or other non-technical
                            considerations.</p>
