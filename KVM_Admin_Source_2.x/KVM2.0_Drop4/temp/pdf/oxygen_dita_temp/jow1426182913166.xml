  <!-- how can you specify that a VM needs a host from a given host aggregate? 
  JO 2015-03-17 CHris F sends the following:
  
  This is all regular upstream stuff, so I'm not sure how much we need to cover. 
(On the other hand the upstream docs aren't very thorough on this topic.)

Host aggregates can normally only be manipulated by someone with admin privileges, not normal users.

There are two ways to specify a particular host aggregate:

The first is to use the AggregateInstanceExtraSpecsFilter to match flavor extra specs (that start with "aggregate_instance_extra_specs:") against host aggregate metadata.  This is essentially implicit in that the end-user selects the flavor and "behind the scenes" that has implications about host aggregates.  Because only the admin user can set the extra specs on the flavor, this means that it's the admin rather than the regular end-user that sets up the relationship between flavor/aggregate.  This technique works for all host aggregates.

It's possible to expose a host aggregate as an availability zone.  Like it sounds, this is intended to group hosts together such that they are in different "zones" that could be reasonably expected not to fail simultaneously.  So different physical networks, or different power grids, or even different physical locations.  A given host is only supposed to be in one availability 
zone at a time, though it can be in multiple aggregates.   (Personally I think 
they should allow multiple orthogonal availability zones, but they don't currently.)

For host aggregates that are exposed as an availability zone, the end-user can select the availability zone at instance creation time and this will constrain it to the set of hosts in the corresponding host aggregate.  An instance can only be placed in one availability zone at a time.
